@  Washington, an Exchange Ally, Seems
@  To Be Strong Candidate to Head SEC

<TXT>
<p>
   Consuela Washington, a longtime House staffer and
an expert in securities laws, is a leading candidate to be
chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Clinton
administration.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. Washington, 44 years old, would be the first woman and the
first black to head the five-member commission that oversees the
securities markets.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. Washington's candidacy is being championed by several
powerful lawmakers including her boss, Chairman John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. She currently is
a counsel to the committee. Ms. Washington and Mr. Dingell have been
considered allies of the securities exchanges, while banks and
futures exchanges have often fought with them.
</p>
<p>
   A graduate of Harvard Law School, Ms. Washington worked as a
laywer for the corporate finance division of the SEC in the late
1970s. She has been a congressional staffer since 1979.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, Clinton transition officials said that Frank Newman,
50, vice chairman and chief financial officer of BankAmerica Corp.,
is expected to be nominated as assistant Treasury secretary for
domestic finance. Mr. Newman, who would be giving up a job that pays
$1 million a year, would oversee the Treasury's auctions of
government securities as well as banking issues. He would report
directly to Treasury Secretary-designate Lloyd Bentsen.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Bentsen, who headed the Senate Finance Committee for the past
six years, also is expected to nominate Samuel Sessions, the
committee's chief tax counsel, to one of the top tax jobs at
Treasury.
</p>
<p>
   As early as today, the Clinton camp is expected to name five
undersecretaries of state and several assistant secretaries. Peter
Tarnoff, a former Carter administration official and president of
the Council on Foreign Relations, is expected to be named
undersecretary for political affairs. Former Sen. Tim Wirth is
expected to get a newly created undersecretary post for global
affairs, which would include refugees, drugs and environmental
issues. Earlier, the Colorado Democrat had been a leading contender
to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, Joan Spero, an executive vice president of American
Express Co., is a leading candidate for undersecretary for economic
affairs. And Time magazine columnist Strobe Talbott is to be named
ambassador-at-large to coordinate U.S. policy toward the former
Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
   Several appointees of President Bush are likely to stay in office
at least temporarily, until permanent successors can be named. One
is Bernadine Healy, director of the National Institutes of Health.
Another likely holdover is David Kessler, head of the Food and Drug
Administration.
</p>
<p>
   In the offfice of U.S. Trade Representative-designate Mickey
Kantor, selections for the three deputy trade representative slots
and general counsel are still to be decided. But Robert Kyle, the
Senate Finance Committee's trade counsel, is considered a top
candidate for one of the slots or for a trade post elsewhere in the
government.
</p>
<p>
   For many subcabinet jobs, the list of candidates has been
narrowed considerably. Clinton officials are said to be deciding
between recently retired Rep. Matthew McHugh (D., N.Y.) and
environmental activist and transition official Gus Speth for the
director of the Agency for International Development.
</p>
<p>
   Among others expected to be hired include Kitty Higgins, an aide
to Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, as chief of staff in the Labor
Department, while Jerry Palast of the Service Employees
International Union is expected to be the department's director of
legislative affairs.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, the incoming Clinton administration is seriously
considering moving the briefing room for the press, for decades
situated in the West Wing of the White House, out of the White House
and into the Old Executive Office Building next door. The current
briefing room could be used for staff offices.

@  Murdoch's Interest in New York Post
@  Seems to Pose Dilemma for News Corp.

<TXT>
<p>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed his interest in
buying back the ailing New York Post. But analysts said that if he
winds up bidding for the paper, he faces a no-win situation in the
overcrowded New York newspaper market.
</p>
<p>
   While Mr. Murdoch appears to have the money to keep the paper
going, investing in a troubled newspaper would seem at odds with
News Corp.'s current strategic moves away from newspapers and into
electronic news and information delivery, industry analysts said.
They also said that the Post may not survive long enough for Mr.
Murdoch to get the necessary approval to buy the paper, which he
owned from 1976 to 1988.
</p>
<p>
   Patrick Purcell, chief executive of News Corp.'s News America
Publishing unit, said yesterday, "We have been asked by various
public officials if we would consider taking a look at it, and we
are." He added, "Newspapers are something he Mr. Murdoch loves. I
don't think he has ever lost interest in them."
</p>
<p>
   But at issue is whether Mr. Murdoch can overcome federal
regulations that would prevent him from bidding for the Post. Under
Federal Communications Commission regulations prohibiting
crossownership, Mr. Murdoch is barred from owning both a newspaper
and television station in the same market. After Mr. Murdoch bought
the Post, he acquired local television station WNYW-TV in 1986, and
he was forced to sell the paper two years later.
</p>
<p>
   With some political maneuvering, Mr. Murdoch could be granted a
waiver from the FCC that would allow him to own the Post and his Fox
Broadcasting Co. network affiliate. "The cross-ownership issue is a
concern," Mr. Purcell conceded. "If there were an FCC waiver, we
would consider buying the Post."
</p>
<p>
   A Murdoch bid would compete with businessman Abraham Hirschfeld
who has an option to buy the unprofitable paper.
</p>
<p>
   The Post, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-protection,
is estimated to have losses of $10 million a year under its current
owner, real estate developer Peter Kalikow; is losing circulation,
and faces increased competition from a rejuvenated New York Daily
News. Even News Corp.'s Mr. Purcell called the Post "a tough
financial situation."
</p>
<p>
   Analysts were puzzled by Mr. Murdoch's new interest in the paper.
"I just don't get it. I don't know what sort of synergy it
represents" said Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.

@  Chrysler's York
@  As Finance Chief

@  Signals Strategy of Cuts

<TXT>
<p>
   International Business Machines Corp. continued its executive
makeover by hiring Jerome B. York, an architect of the turnaround at
Chrysler Corp., to become chief financial officer.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. York, 54 years old, is a West Point graduate who helped
transform Chrysler by slashing costs and selling billions of dollars
in assets. His appointment is a strong sign that IBM's new chairman,
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., plans a similar strategy at the wounded
computer giant.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Gerstner raced to hire Mr. York after meeting him for the
first time just three weeks ago in IBM's Manhattan offices. In his
first month, Mr. Gerstner has also brought in outsiders to run IBM's
communications and disk-drive business, and is searching for a new
head of personnel.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. York was executive vice president for finance and a board
member at Chrysler, where he spent 12 years in financial posts and
running several car and truck divisions. Chrysler didn't name a
successor yesterday. While it may look outside the company, it has
several inside candidates.
</p>
<p>
   A lean, intense man with a piercing stare, Mr. York was known at
Chrysler for his obsessive work hours, especially during the auto
maker's near-collapse in the late 1970s.
</p>
<p>
   "At one meeting in 1979, I turned to him to make a presentation
and he said, `Steve, you better handle this, I don't feel so good.'
Then he passed out and security guys had to come take him away on a
stretcher," recalled former Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert S. "Steve"
Miller. "It was just exhaustion from too many all-nighters, too much
coffee and cigarettes instead of the old sustenance."
</p>
<p>
   IBM's selection of Mr. York was first reported by USA Today.
</p>
<p>
   At IBM, Mr. York will face what he yesterday called "the most
challenging situation of this era." IBM had losses of nearly $5
billion last year and saw its stock price cut in half amid the nose
dive of its mainframe computer business.
</p>
<p>
   While IBM's balance sheet and core finances have remained stable,
it has lost much credibility on Wall Street and has been stripped of
its prized triple-A credit rating. Its longtime chief financial
officer, Frank Metz, took early retirement in the January executive
shake-up that also pushed aside ex-chairman John Akers.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. York will also be arriving at IBM amid charges by some
financial experts that the company is too aggressive about reporting
revenue that it may never actually get through complex sales
gimmicks and a rare leasing maneuver. In an April 7 Wall Street
Journal article, several experts suggested that IBM's accounting
grew much more liberal since the mid-1980s as its business turned
sour. IBM adamantly disputes these charges.
</p>
<p>
   In an interview yesterday, Mr. York wouldn't yet commit himself
to cost-cutting or any other specific strategy.
</p>
<p>
   "Reading the published financial data, IBM's costs don't appear
to me to be out of control," he said. "But on the other hand, if the
revenue side of the equation does not come back to former levels,
then probably there's going to have to be some reductions on the
cost side."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. York led the effort to control costs at Chrysler in the late
1980s, when, for the second time in a decade, the car giant faced a
financial crisis. With outdated products and bloated overhead,
Chrysler's earnings plunged from an operating profit of more than $1
billion in 1988 to an operating loss of $538 million in 1991.
</p>
<p>
   The company's unfunded pension liability soared and its credit
rating dropped below junk levels. Some analysts were predicting
Chrysler's demise as an independent auto maker.
</p>
<p>
   In response, Chrysler cut in half the time and money invested in
new car lines and wrung savings from cooperating more with
suppliers. It also pumped money into new products, including the
high-profile Neon, a small car it says it spent only $1.3 billion to
develop.
</p>
<p>
   The result was that last year Chrysler reported net of $723
million, the only Big Three auto maker to turn a profit. Its stock
has also soared from around $10 a share just two years ago. In New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, it was quoted at
$42.125, up 87.5 cents a share.
</p>
<p>
   Early this year Mr. York led Chrysler through one of the largest
stock sales ever for a U.S. industrial company, raising $1.78
billion. Chrysler is using most of the proceeds to reduce its $4.4
billion unfunded pension liability.
</p>
<p>
   IBM and Mr. York wouldn't discuss his compensation package, which
could easily reach into seven figures. The subject is sensitive at a
time when IBM is running big losses and laying off thousands of
employees. At last week's annual meeting, Mr. Gerstner faced angry
questions about his $3.5 million annual salary and bonus.
</p>
<p>
   Chrysler last year paid Mr. York $414,167 in salary, a $300,000
bonus and $327,621 in long-term compensation based on quality
improvements in the company's products. By contrast, IBM paid Mr.
Metz, its former chief financial officer, a total of $725,000 last
year.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. York also had stock options that Chrysler valued at $2.9
million at the end of 1992. Normally, IBM would be expected to give
Mr. York a one-time payment to cover the options he leaves behind.
</p>
<p>
   IBM launched its search for a financial officer in January, two
months before Mr. Gerstner arrived. With Mr. Akers a lame duck, vice
chairman and acting CFO Paul Rizzo ran the search.
</p>
<p>
   After Mr. Gerstner took over April 1, Mr. Rizzo and Russell
Reynolds Associates search consultant Andrew Hart presented the new
chairman with five finalists. Mr. Gerstner chose to interview only
two: Mr. York and another executive who wasn't identified.
</p>
<p>
   In Big Board trading, IBM shares were quoted at $49.25, up 62.5
cents, but analysts said the rise wasn't connected to the hiring of
Mr. York.
</p>
<p>
   At Chrysler, Mr. York had been a dark-horse candidate to succeed
departing chairman Lee A. Iacocca. Chrysler ultimately chose former
General Motors Corp. executive Robert Eaton. The succession struggle
left relations somewhat strained between Mr. York and Chrysler
President Robert Lutz, who had been another contender for the top
job.
</p>
<p>
   Chrysler said Mr. York's subordinates would report temporarily to
Mr. Eaton. Candidates from within Chrysler to succeed Mr. York
include Gary C. Valade, human resources chief; Thomas P. Capo,
treasurer; and Thomas W. Sidlik, vice president for customer
satisfaction and quality.
</p>
<p>
   After graduating from West Point, Mr. York got a masters in
structural engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and an M.B.A. at the University of Michigan. A native of
Memphis, Tenn., he said he spends his spare time working as a
"gentleman farmer" and hunting deer, elk, and antelope.

   Michael D. Casey, a top Johnson & Johnson

</p>

   Mr. Casey, 46 years old, was president of J&J's McNeil

   Mr. Casey succeeds M. James Barrett, 50, as president of Genetic

</p>
<p>
   Mr. Casey said he made the move to the smaller company because he
saw health care moving toward technologies like the company's gene
therapy products. "I believe that the field is emerging and is
prepared to break loose," he said.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Casey declined to divulge his compensation, which he said was

portion was higher at Genetic Therapy.
</p>
<p>
   Noting other recent moves by pharmaceutical executives to small
biotech companies, John T.W. Hawkins, the executive recruiter who
arranged the Genetic Therapy placement, said, "The equity play is
obviously the draw for many of these executives in evaluating small
and emerging companies." But, he added, "fundamentally, it's the
excitement and challenge of building an emerging pharmaceutical
company" that attracts the executives.

   Petrie Stores Corp., Secaucus, N.J., said an uncertain economy
and faltering sales probably will result in a second-quarter loss
and perhaps a deficit for the first six months of fiscal 1994.
</p>
<p>
   The women's apparel specialty retailer said sales at stores open
more than one year, a key barometer of a retail concern's strength,
declined 2.5% in May, June and the first week of July. The company
operates 1,714 stores.
</p>
<p>
   In fiscal 1993's second quarter, ended last Aug. 1, the company
had net income of $1.5 million, or three cents a share, on revenue
of about $355 million. In the first six months of fiscal 1993, net
was $8.4 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of about $678
million.
</p>
<p>
   Directors also approved the election of Allan Laufgraben, 54

@  Group of Top Executives Urges Congress
@  To Pass Clinton's Deficit-Cutting Plan

<TXT>
<p>
   A group of top corporate executives urged Congress
to pass President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan, declaring that
it is superior to the only apparent alternative: more gridlock.
</p>
<p>
   "There are things in the president's plan that I don't like and
things that aren't in there that I'd like to see," said Stephen
Wolf, chairman of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines. "But, on balance,
it's a significant step forward."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Wolf, whose sentiments were widely shared by his colleagues,
joined 68 other executives who lunched with the president and then
assembled in the East Room of the White House in a show of support
for the Clinton program.
</p>
<p>
   The meeting went far beyond Mr. Clinton's normal weekly gathering
of business leaders. Economic adviser Gene Sperling described it as
"a true full-court press" to pass the deficit-reduction bill, the
final version of which is now being hammered out by House and Senate
negotiators.
</p>
<p>
   The executives' backing -- however tepid -- gives the
administration a way to counter business critics of the overall
package, while providing the White House and Treasury more levers to
win over reluctant lawmakers. Both parties are using business
leaders as proxies of sorts to put pressure on swing votes in the
Senate and House, and there has been sometimes intense
behind-the-scenes maneuvering to win, or block, endorsements from
CEOs.
</p>
<p>
   By having Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s Chairman Hank Barnette turn up
in the East Room, for example, Democrats are in a stronger position
to win over Rep. Paul McHale, a Pennsylvania freshman from the
steelmaker's home town who voted against the deficit package when it
first passed the House.
</p>
<p>
   The executives "are here, just as I am, not because any one
agrees with every last line and jot and tittle of this economic
program," Mr. Clinton acknowledged, but "because it does far more
good than harm."
</p>
<p>
   Despite resistance from some lawmakers in his own party, the
president predicted the bill would pass. "The atmosphere in
discussions here is not as bad as -- if anything, it's a little
better than -- it was before the initial votes were taken in the
Senate and the House," he said. At that time, the package barely
cleared both chambers; Vice President Al Gore's vote was needed to
snap a Senate tie.
</p>
<p>
   Some of the executives who attended yesterday's session weren't a
surprise. Tenneco Inc. Chairman Michael Walsh, for instance, is a
staunch Democrat who provided an early endorsement for Mr. Clinton
during the presidential campaign. Xerox Corp.'s Chairman Paul
Allaire was one of the few top corporate chief executive officers
who contributed money to the Clinton campaign. And others, such as
Atlantic Richfield Co. Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook and Zenith
Electronics Corp. Chairman Jerry Pearlman, have also previously
voiced their approval of Mr. Clinton's economic strategy.
</p>
<p>
   But some faces were fresh. Norman Augustine, the chairman of
defense contractor Martin Marietta Corp., is a registered Republican
who has never stood behind Mr. Clinton. It was also the first formal
show of support by Rand Araskog, the chairman of ITT Corp.
</p>
<p>
   Among those who also attended yesterday's gathering were Dwayne
Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co.; Rodney Chase,
president of BP America Inc.; Ronald Hall, chief executive of Citgo
Petroleum Corp.; Felix Rohatyn, a partner with Lazard Freres & Co.;
Edgar Bronfman Jr., president of Seagram Co.; John Johnson, chairman
of Johnson Publishing Co.; Robert Burt, chairman of FMC Corp.; Ray
Irani, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; Donald Marron,
chairman of PaineWebber Group Inc.; I. MacAllister Booth, chairman
of Polaroid Corp.; William Smithburg, chairman of Quaker Oats Co.;
Deryck Maughan, chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc.; Philip Carroll,
president of Shell Oil Co.; Robert Campbell, chairman of Sun Co.;
Sheryl Handler, chief executive of Thinking Machines Corp.; and
Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc.
</p>
<p>
   Some of the executives also signed letters on behalf of the
Clinton program. Nearly all of them praised the president for his
efforts to pare the deficit.
</p>
<p>
   "This is not necessarily the package I would design," said Martin
Marietta's Mr. Augustine. "But we have to attack the deficit."

   Washington Post Co. said Katharine Graham stepped
down after 20 years as chairman, and will be succeeded by her son,
Donald E. Graham, the company's chief executive officer.
</p>
<p>
   The departure of the matriarch of the Graham publishing empire
came as little surprise to media analysts, who have been
anticipating Mr. Graham's ascent to the top spot. Mrs. Graham, 76
years old, has not been involved in day-to-day operations at the
company since May 1991, when Mr. Graham assumed the chief executive
officer's title.
</p>
<p>
   In the past several years as the head of Washington Post Co.,
Mrs. Graham directed the expansion of the company's cable television
properties and the acquisition of television stations.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Graham, 48, will remain the company's chief executive officer
and publisher of the Washington Post newspaper. A company spokesman
said Mr. Graham would now assume more of the traditional functions
handled by the chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Alan G. Spoon, 42, will succeed Mr. Graham as president of the
company. Mr. Spoon became executive vice president and chief
operating officer in May 1991, following a stint as president of
Newsweek, a magazine owned by Washington Post. He retains the title
of chief operating officer.
</p>
<p>
   Mrs. Graham remains a director of the company as chairman of the
board's executive committee, which will also include Messrs. Graham
and Spoon.

<p>
   After much melodrama, media baron Rupert Murdoch once
again owns the ailing New York Post.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Murdoch, chairman and chief executive officer of News Corp.,
completed his $25 million purchase of the bankrupt tabloid Friday,
after threatening twice in recent months to cancel the purchase over
labor disputes. He was lured back last week by promises from nine
craft unions at the Post that they wouldn't honor a strike by the
Newspaper Guild, and once Friday's paper was published without
disruption, Mr. Murdoch closed the deal.
</p>
<p>
   Without support from the other unions, the Guild, which
represents nearly 300 of the Post's 700 employees, voted Saturday to
end its strike. Guild members have been invited to reapply for their
old jobs today, though it is assumed that dozens of them won't be
rehired.
</p>
<p>
   Despite his labor victory, Mr. Murdoch faces major obstacles in
turning around the Post, which has had losses of about $15 million a
year. With the disruptions of multiple owners, bankruptcy and the
retailing recession, both circulation and advertising have fallen
sharply since News Corp. last owned the paper, from 1976 to 1988.
Circulation alone has fallen to about 400,000 from one million a
decade ago. Also, the Post has to compete with two other deep-pocket
tabloid owners, Mortimer B. Zuckerman of New York's Daily News, and
Times Mirror Co., which publishes New York Newsday.
</p>
<p>
   A spokesman for Mr. Murdoch said he believes he can revitalize
the paper while continuing to cut costs. Though the Post might never
be profitable, News Corp. insiders say Mr. Murdoch's goal isn't
merely monetary, but to regain a major metropolitan daily as a
platform for his conservative views.

<HL>    Dean Foods Will Buy Birds Eye Brand
@  From Philip Morris Unit for $140 Million
@  ----
@  By Richard Gibson
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 11/02/93 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8 </SO>
<CO>    DF MO </CO>
<IN> FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD), FOOD PRODUCERS, EXCLUDING FISHING (OFP),
   TOBACCO (TOB) </IN>
<TXT>
<p>
   Dean Foods Co., already the country's leading processor of
private-label frozen vegetables, agreed to acquire the Birds Eye
frozen vegetables brand from Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft General Foods
for $140 million.
</p>
<p>
   If approved by federal regulators -- both the company and
industry analysts say they expect no opposition -- the acquisition
would nearly double Dean's vegetable sales and give it the broadest
array of products in the marketplace as well as the oldest name in
the frozen category.
</p>
<p>
   The acquisition would more than double Dean's annual sales of
frozen vegetables, to about $460 million, and increase the company's
portion of the U.S.'s $3.6 billion processed-vegetables market to
nearly 17% from about 10%. For the year ended May 30, Dean reported
vegetable sales of $347 million, or about 15% of its $2.3 billion
total sales. Dean is the nation's second-largest dairy, behind
Borden Inc.
</p>
<p>
   "They offer us all kinds of new blends and value-added products
we're not doing," Howard Dean, chairman and chief executive of the
Franklin Park, Ill., company, said of the acquisition. "We think it
complements our line very well and gives us a great national brand."
</p>
<p>
   Dean hasn't been successful in marketing prepared frozen
vegetables in ready-to-heat sauces, a category in which Birds Eye
has numerous offerings. While the market for plain sliced-and-diced
vegetables has been flat, the one for so-called value-added
products, which also includes vegetables with pasta, is growing.
</p>
<p>
   Dean's major brands include Veg-All canned vegetables and
Freshlike, a frozen and canned line sold primarily in the Midwest.
</p>
<p>
   Kraft said last month it was considering selling Birds Eye, the
No. 2 frozen-vegetables brand in the U.S. behind Grand Metropolitan
PLC's Green Giant. At the time a Kraft executive, explaining the
decision, said, "You can be either really big and develop
significant economies of scale or you can be very focused and go
after segments that are attractive. Where you don't want to be is
somewhere in the middle."
</p>
<p>
   Without a canned line, and bruised in the commodity-like plain
vegetables market, Birds Eye was more susceptible to economic
swings. Lately the vegetable market has been hit by flooding and
fickle consumers. Moreover, where Birds Eye processed only about
one-third of the vegetables it sells, Dean handles crops from field
to supermarket shelf. The Birds Eye acquisition also includes a
small frozen-fruit business.
</p>
<p>
   Investors like the prospects. Dean's stock jumped about 6% on the
news to close at $27.125, up $1.50, in composite New York Stock
Exchange trading.
</p>
<p>
   "It definitely makes sense," said Ravi Sadarangani, food analyst
with William Blair & Co. in Chicago. Buying Birds Eye reduces Dean's
earnings volatility "because Dean has traditionally been in the
private-label segment, where prices are more susceptible to
commodity cycles." Birds Eye's premium products aren't as vulnerable
to such fluctuations, he said.
</p>
<p>
   Food analyst George Dahlman at Piper, Jaffray in Minneapolis
said, "This is a time in the vegetable industry for financially
strong and smart companies to get in deeper. The industry is at a
cyclical bottom so Dean is doubly leveraged to take advantage of
recovery."
</p>
<p>
   The acquisition would include three plants, in Minnesota, New
York and Mexico, increasing Dean's processing facilities to 18. Mr.
Dean said the company intends to retain Birds Eye's production,
sales and distribution force, but to pare some administration
personnel. Birds Eye, now part of Kraft's All-American Gourmet Co.,
is based in Orange, Calif., and has about 900 employees.
</p>
<p>
   Dean was among numerous bidders for Birds Eye, including Unilever
NV, a Dutch company that recently acquired the Breyer's ice cream
business from Kraft.

<p>
   SHL Systemhouse Inc., Ottawa, said it expects to report an
operating loss for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Aug. 31.
</p>
<p>
   The computer-services company didn't indicate the size of the
anticipated loss. It attributed the shortfall partly to delays in
signing and starting work on major contracts.
</p>
<p>
   Systemhouse also said it expects to record a "major"
restructuring charge of more than 135 million Canadian dollars
(US$102.7 million) in the fourth quarter.
</p>
<p>
   The company's fourth-quarter financial results are due out at the
end of November. In the 1992 fourth quarter, Systemhouse had a net
loss of C$7.4 million, or 18 Canadian cents a share, on revenue of
C$190.4 million.
</p>
<p>
   Systemhouse also said it appointed Paul Damp, 38 years old,
president and chief operating officer. Mr. Damp was previously vice
chairman and chief financial officer. He will succeed James Burns,
46, who was appointed Systemhouse's vice chairman with
responsibility for business development. Mr. Damp will continue to
serve as chief financial officer until a replacement is found.

<p>
   Sun Microsystems Inc. said fiscal
second-quarter profit nearly doubled on an 8% increase in revenue,
in line with analysts' expectations.
</p>
<p>
   Net income for the period ended Dec. 26 was $43.8 million, or 46
cents a share, up 82% from $24.1 million, or 23 cents a share, a
year earlier, when Sun was hit by product start-up costs and
shortages.
</p>
<p>
   Although the results were "a little lighter" than the 49 cents a
share he hoped for, Salomon Brothers analyst Jeff Canin said he was
pleased with Sun's gross margins for the quarter, which were 39%, up
sharply from 23% a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
   Revenue rose to $1.13 billion from $1.05 billion, and back orders
reached record levels. Sun cited high demand for new products,
especially its new servers, high-end ZX and SX graphics workstations
and Solaris software.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, Sun said Michael Lehman, Sun's vice president and
corporate controller, will assume the post of chief financial
officer on March 1.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Lehman succeeds Kevin Melia who is moving to the East Coast
for personal reasons. Mr. Melia will continue to serve as acting
president of its Sun Microsystems Computer Corp. unit until a
successor is named, and as a member of Sun's executive management
group.
</p>
<p>
   In an interview, Mr. Melia, 44 years old, said he ruled out
continuing as CFO from Boston because "it wouldn't be fair." Even in
this age of desktop video conferencing, executives need to make many
of their decisions in "real time" face-to-face, and often informal
meetings, he said.
</p>
<p>
   Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy said he and Mr. Melia are
"evaluating a number of opportunities for him to lead while living
on the East Coast."

@  Blacks' Increasing Vocal Opposition to Violence
@  Is Matched by Strong Opposition to Crime Bill
@  ----
@  By Joe Davidson
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 01/27/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16 </SO>
<DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the often fiery Rainbow
Coalition president, was subdued, reflective, nearly rhymeless.
</p>
<p>
   At a recent hearing of the Congressional Black Caucus brain trust
on crime, he spoke solemnly, his voice breaking, of how some young
black men feel "more secure in jails than on our streets." With
tears in his eyes, he spoke of death in his own neighborhood here
and the precarious position of black youth. "Nearly half of all
murder victims are black," he said. "More blacks kill each other
each year than were killed in the entire history of lynching."
</p>
<p>
   Yet, the Rev. Jackson assailed one of the prime legislative
vehicles for dealing with that explosion of violence -- the
Senate-passed crime legislation that President Clinton backed in his
State of the Union address. The measure, he declared, is an
"ill-conceived bill" and a "Draconian . . . expensive non-remedy."
</p>
<p>
   The bill has widespread bipartisan support in the Senate.
Lawmakers contend it represents the toughest and most comprehensive
government attack yet on violent crime, an issue at the top of the
public's list of concerns in opinion polls.
</p>
<p>
   But at a time when African-Americans increasingly are speaking
out against black criminals and the "gangsta rap" that seems to
glorify violence, the Black Caucus and others say the Senate bill is
too concerned with punishment, and not enough concerned with the
alleviation of the conditions that cause crime. The strong
opposition to the measure presents a problem for President Clinton,
whose support for the legislation places him at odds with a core
group of Democrats who elected him.
</p>
<p>
   Citing Mr. Clinton's embrace of one provision of the Senate bill
-- mandatory life sentences for criminals convicted of three violent
felonies -- the dean of the Black Caucus, Democratic Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, decries the "lock-'em up and throw away the
key" approach that "only fools the public into believing that we're
doing something about crime."
</p>
<p>
   The White House will try to assuage at least some opponents'
concerns as Congress undertakes to reconcile the Senate bill with a
much different House measure. Justice Department officials, who were
criticized for not visibly exerting influence over the Senate bill
last year, will play a more overt role in removing or modifying the
more extreme provisions this year. Deputy Attorney General Philip
Heymann plans to testify at House crime legislation hearings, and
Mr. Clinton himself held out the carrot of help to endangered youth
in his speech to Congress. "We have got to stop pointing our fingers
at these kids who have no future," he said, "and reach our hands out
to them."
</p>
<p>
   The question, though, is whether enough changes can be made to
the bill to soften opposition to it. In addition to the Black
Caucus, a range of others -- including the American Bar Association,
the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Conference of State
Legislators and many federal judges and prosecutors -- oppose
stringent sentencing provisions in the bill. Other less
controversial provisions in the $22.3 billion legislation include
authorization for 100,000 additional police officers, drug treatment
and other crime-prevention programs.
</p>
<p>
   Some black leaders, such as the leadership of the Nation of
Islam, have long spoken out against crime and for the kind of values
that make it unacceptable. But the mainstream civil-rights
leadership generally avoided the rhetoric of "law and order,"
regarding it as a code for keeping blacks back. Law and order didn't
mean justice, Mr. Jackson used to say, but "just us."
</p>
<p>
   In the past, many were hesitant to speak about crime in public
because "the larger community would talk about 'lock them up and
throw the key away' and hide behind black leaders in doing it,"
explains Rep. Craig Washington, the Houston Democrat who led the
caucus hearing.
</p>
<p>
   Now there is escalating discourse within the black community
about what it can and must do to stop crime. Just after the new
year, Mr. Jackson held the first of several conferences focusing on
just that. "The premier civil-rights issue of this day is youth
violence in general and black-on-black violence in particular," he
has said. His conference also noted the structural conditions that
encourage crime -- the sorry state of the black economy, high
unemployment, poor education and a legacy of racism.
</p>
<p>
   "The black leaders recognize that if they don't step out front
and engage in the discussion, that basically our young people are
turning themselves into slaves," says Rep. Washington. Within the
black community, there is "more public concern and debate about the
appropriate level of response to increasing crime and violence."
</p>
<p>
   Many of the black leaders involved in the growing debate retain
strong objections to the Senate bill, with its large number of
mandatory minimum sentences, death penalties and federalization of
local crimes.
</p>
<p>
   One of the Senate measures strongly opposed by most members of
the Black Caucus has as its author one of its own, Illinois
Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun. Her amendment would restrict
prosecutorial discretion -- a point opposed by Attorney General
Janet Reno -- by directing U.S. attorneys to prosecute as adults
13-year-olds charged with committing violent crimes with firearms.
</p>
<p>
   The provision would federalize many crimes currently prosecuted
by the states. Yet, notes federal Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of
Newark, N.J., who is chairwoman of the criminal law committee of the
Judicial Conference of the U.S., there is no federal juvenile
justice system to handle such cases -- no federal juvenile prisons,
for instance, and no federal youth probation officers.
</p>
<p>
   The National Conference of State Legislatures is so opposed to
the federalization of state crimes -- another provision in the bill,
pushed by GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, would federalize all
violent handgun crimes -- that it recently wrote President Clinton
to say "the Senate bill is inimical to principles of federalism, and
we must oppose it." And a measure that would require states to adopt
certain federal sentencing guidelines, such as mandatory minimum
sentences, to get federal prison building funds is "coercive
policy," complains Jon Felde, NCSL's general counsel.
</p>
<p>
   There are numerous mandatory minimum provisions in the
legislation that Mr. Washington fears could be used in an unfair
fashion against blacks who may be charged more harshly than whites
for similar acts. And federal judges have "consistently, vehemently,
and virtually unanimously opposed" mandatory minimum sentences,
Judge Barry wrote to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden, Democrat of Delaware, in November.
</p>
<p>
   Other measures that caucus members say could be used in a
discriminatory way are those that would make it a federal crime to
conspire to participate in a criminal street gang and that provides
the death penalty for drug kingpins even if no death can be shown to
have resulted directly from their illegal activity. The Justice
Department has warned Congress that it thinks the drugkingpin
provision is unconstitutional; the anti-gang measure will also be
hit on constitutional grounds in the House.
</p>
<p>
   But Sen. Biden insists that the final legislation will include
enough significant prevention and punishment provisions that
liberals and conservatives alike will be able to endorse it. After
all, he says, "everybody is kind of singing from the same hymnal on
the broad strokes."

@  Law Firms Repackage Themselves
@  For High-Tech World of Multimedia
@
</p>
<p>
   THESE DAYS, it seems everybody wants to be a multimedia star.
</p>
<p>
   Lawyers, like others in the business of selling professional
services, are rushing to market themselves to the
telecommunications, computer and entertainment industries. Trouble
is, nobody agrees what it really means to be a multimedia lawyer. Or
an interactive law firm. Or whether there is such a thing as
practicing on the information superhighway.
</p>
<p>
   Some law firms touting their multimedia experts simply mean they
represent software companies in patent disputes. Other law firms do
regulatory and lobbying work for cable companies. And a few even try
to draw distinctions between information-superhighway lawyers, who
handle telecommunications work, and multimedia lawyers, who make
deals between high-tech and entertainment companies.
</p>
<p>
   Mostly though, law firms seem to apply these voguish labels to
whatever shape their practice happens to be taking at the moment.
Manatt, Phelps & Phillips of Los Angeles, whose clients include
movie stars and studios, brought in seven intellectual-property
lawyers from another firm in August and immediately issued a news
release trumpeting Manatt's entrance into the "interactive and
multimedia arena." That arena, explains entertainment partner Joseph
Horacek, is where Hollywood's "highest levels of talent" meet
computer executives.
</p>
<p>
   "I have called a number of large independent production companies
or studios, trying to educate them as between the two worlds," Mr.
Horacek says. The firm has yet to complete a single multimedia deal,
but Mr. Horacek says more than a dozen are in the works. Several
other Los Angeles-based firms have recently merged their
entertainment and intellectual-property departments.
@
</p>
<p>
   A FEW firms readily admit they're trying to lure clients into
uncharted legal territory. In promotional materials boasting about
its corporate and trademark-law work on behalf of a maker of
computer software for hospitals, New York's Proskauer, Rose, Goetz &
Mendelsohn said it is entering the "precedent-less field of the
so-called information superhighway." Partner Carole Handler, of the
firm's Los Angeles office, says the firm within a month will
establish a practice group made up of its attorneys in the
"high-tech, information superhighway area."
</p>
<p>
   For the 650-lawyer San Francisco firm Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro,
multimedia doesn't include an entertainment component per se but
instead seems to mean more frequent meetings between members of the
firm's intellectual property and telecommunications departments. The
firm's 15-member "media team," formed six months ago, also includes
antitrust and tax partners.
</p>
<p>
   "We're pulling together niches of our practice areas . . . to
market our multimedia experience and meet existing clients'
demands," says Mary Cranston, head of Pillsbury's telecommunications
practice. The media team is doing corporate work for units of
Pacific Telesis Group, a longstanding client of Pillsbury's, and has
handled patent matters for computer companies.
</p>
<p>
   At a time when glamorous media deals like Viacom Inc.'s
just-completed battle for Paramount Communications Inc. are all the
rage, no major law firm wants to be left behind. Like soft-drink
makers who put the same old stuff in new cans, law firms in many
instances are simply repackaging traditional legal functions such as
licensing and corporate finance.
</p>
<p>
   "This type of legal work has existed for a while," concedes John
Valva, public-relations spokesman for the San Francisco law firm
Farella, Braun & Martel. "It's just that all of a sudden, multimedia
is what it's called." But the head of Farella's new "multimedia
practice group," partner Bruce Maximov, says that, "It's not enough
just to enhance your legal skills." Lawyers in his group have
attended university courses on such subjects as how to design video
games, he says.
</p>
<p>
   Chicago's 450-lawyer Winston & Strawn formed its multimedia
practice group six months ago. Loren Wittner, partner in charge of
marketing, says the firm is following in the footsteps of major
accounting firms, which have organized themselves along
client-industry lines.
</p>
<p>
   But Jon Klemens, of the legal consulting firm Altman Weil Pensa
Inc., says that creating multidisciplinary teams may cause friction
over which traditional department is really controlling the client's
legal work.
@
</p>
<p>
   THE HYPE has many lawyers carping about their competitors'
claims. "Everybody has a slide in their presentation that says
`information superhighway' or `multimedia.' Then they mention three
clients, and no one's ever heard of them," says Hank Barry, partner
in charge of a 22-attorney "technology practice group" at the San
Francisco law firm Cooley, Godward, Castro, Huddleson & Tatum.
</p>
<p>
   As a young lawyer, Mr. Barry worked on movie deals at a New York
law firm. Now his clients are Silicon Valley start-up companies. "I
think there are probably only 10 lawyers in the country who can
legitimately say they've done major-league entertainment work and
major-league high-tech work," says Mr. Barry, who numbers himself
among them. He represented Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co. two years ago in its high-profile deal with 3DO Co., a Mountain
View, Calif., maker of interactive games and equipment, but says he
hasn't been involved in any multimedia transactions valued at more
than $10 million.
</p>
<p>
   What the brouhaha may boil down to is an attempt by big firms,
especially those that had lost market share to small
intellectual-property boutiques, to regain clients by claiming to
offer them one-stop shopping.
</p>
<p>
   Clients, however, may not be completely convinced. Hal Kruth,
vice president of law and business development at Kaleida Labs Inc.,
a Mountain View software company, says he "can go to a patent lawyer
and hook them up with a very good corporate lawyer at another firm
and say, `Look, I want you guys to work together.'"
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Kruth says he isn't taken in by trendy titles. When he wants
to hire a law firm, he looks for a strong record in a particular
area of the law. "There's no such thing as multimedia law," he says.
"What there is, is intellectual-property law, corporate law, and
contract work akin to entertainment-industry stuff. . . . It's still
the same basic legal skills."

@  Five Top Executives
@  To Exercise Options
@  ---
@  Move Generates $200 Million
@  In Tax deductions for Use
@  In Offsetting Gain on Sale
@  ----
@  By Timothy D. Schellhardt
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 02/23/94 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B5 </SO>

<TXT>
<p>
   Conseco Inc., in a move to generate about $200 million in tax
deductions, said it induced five of its top executives to exercise
stock options to purchase about 3.6 million common shares of the
financial-services concern. As a result of the transaction, the
executives are about $100 million richer in Conseco shares.
</p>
<p>
   The company, based in Carmel, Ind., also said that as an
inducement to exercise early their stock options, the officials --
its chief executive officer and four executive vice presidents --
received new options to buy 1.8 million shares at current market
prices. That figure equals the number of shares withheld to pay
federal and state taxes owed by the executives because of the deal.
The company actually issued the executives 1.8 million common
shares.
</p>
<p>
   Conseco said it plans to use the $200 million tax deduction to
offset taxable income, including the gain from the recent sale of
its 60% interest in Western National Corp., the newly public parent
of Western National Life Insurance Co. The $200 million is
considered executive compensation and therefore is deductible by the
company.
</p>
<p>
   The five executives are Stephen C. Hilbert, chairman, president
and chief executive officer, and executive vice presidents Rollin M.
Dick, Donald F. Gongaware, Walter T. Kirkbride and Lawrence W.
Inlow. Conseco said that because of their exercised stock options,
its executives and directors own about 8% of the company's 26.3
million common shares outstanding, up from a 5.7% stake at year-end
1993.
</p>
<p>
   A company spokesman said the average option price for the 3.6
million shares was $3.70 a share. The options were granted between
1987 and 1990, and the $3.70-a-share option price reflects two
2-for-1 stock splits, in 1991 and 1992.
</p>
<p>
   Conseco shares closed unchanged at $56 in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading.
</p>
<p>
   Judy Fischer, publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, said
that while the shares exercised represent "a pretty good amount of
money," the arrangement isn't unusual. "It especially wasn't unusual
in 1993 to have companies accelerating the vesting of options for
tax purposes," she said.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. Fischer also said that the withholding of shares to pay for
the executives' tax liabilities is a common feature of executive
stock-option plans. But she said that Conseco's granting of new
options to the executives -- so-called "reload" options, equal to
the number of shares used to pay taxes -- is a new feature that
companies have begun to put into stock-option plans the past few
years. "That reload option is an answer to critics who contend that
executives don't have enough ownership in their companies," she
said. The new options remain exercisable until 1999 and 2000, which
was the exercise period available under the old options.
</p>
<p>
   In a related matter, Conseco said it repurchased about 684,000
common shares from the marital estate of Mr. Hilbert and his ex-wife
as part of the company's two million common-share buyback program
announced last November. The company said independent directors
authorized the repurchase to permit the settlement of the Hilberts'
recent divorce proceeding without hurting the market for the stock.
Conseco said that Mr. Hilbert and the other four executives have no
intention to sell any shares in the foreseeable future.

<HL>    Marketing & Media -- Advertising:
@  John Dooner Will Succeed James
@  At Helm of McCann-Erickson

<TXT>
<p>
   One of the many differences between Robert L. James, chairman and
chief executive officer of McCann-Erickson, and John J. Dooner Jr.,
the agency's president and chief operating officer, is quite
telling: Mr. James enjoys sailboating, while Mr. Dooner owns a
powerboat.
</p>
<p>
   Now, Mr. James is preparing to sail into the sunset, and Mr.
Dooner is poised to rev up the engines to guide Interpublic Group's
McCann-Erickson into the 21st century. Yesterday, McCann made
official what had been widely anticipated: Mr. James, 57 years old,
is stepping down as chief executive officer on July 1 and will
retire as chairman at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by
Mr. Dooner, 45.
</p>
<p>
   It promises to be a smooth process, which is unusual given the
volatile atmosphere of the advertising business. But Mr. Dooner has
a big challenge that will be his top priority. "I'm going to focus
on strengthening the creative work," he says. "There is room to
grow. We can make further improvements in terms of the perception of
our creative work."
</p>
<p>
   Even Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber, who believes
McCann is filled with "vitality" and is in "great shape," says that
from a creative standpoint, "You wouldn't pay to see their reel" of
commercials.
</p>
<p>
   While McCann's world-wide billings rose 12% to $6.4 billion last
year from $5.7 billion in 1992, the agency still is dogged by the
loss of the key creative assignment for the prestigious Coca-Cola
Classic account. "I would be less than honest to say I'm not
disappointed not to be able to claim creative leadership for Coke,"
Mr. Dooner says.
</p>
<p>
   McCann still handles promotions and media buying for Coke. But
the bragging rights to Coke's ubiquitous advertising belongs to
Creative Artists Agency, the big Hollywood talent agency. "We are
striving to have a strong renewed creative partnership with
Coca-Cola," Mr. Dooner says. However, odds of that happening are
slim since word from Coke headquarters in Atlanta is that CAA and
other ad agencies, such as Fallon McElligott, will continue to
handle Coke advertising.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Dooner, who recently lost 60 pounds over three-and-a-half
months, says now that he has "reinvented" himself, he wants to do
the same for the agency. For Mr. Dooner, it means maintaining his
running and exercise schedule, and for the agency, it means
developing more global campaigns that nonetheless reflect local
cultures. One McCann account, "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," a
butter substitute, is in 11 countries, for example.
</p>
<p>
   McCann has initiated a new so-called global collaborative system,
composed of world-wide account directors paired with creative
partners. In addition, Peter Kim was hired from WPP Group's J.
Walter Thompson last September as vice chairman, chief strategy
officer, world-wide.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Dooner doesn't see a creative malaise permeating the agency.
He points to several campaigns with pride, including the Taster's
Choice commercials that are like a running soap opera. "It's a $19
million campaign with the recognition of a $200 million campaign,"
he says of the commercials that feature a couple that must hold a
record for the length of time dating before kissing.
</p>
<p>
   Even so, Mr. Dooner is on the prowl for more creative talent and
is interested in acquiring a hot agency. He says he would like to
finalize an acquisition "yesterday. I'm not known for patience."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Dooner met with Martin Puris, president and chief executive
officer of Ammirati & Puris, about McCann's acquiring the agency
with billings of $400 million, but nothing has materialized. "There
is no question," says Mr. Dooner, "that we are looking for quality
acquisitions and Ammirati & Puris is a quality operation. There are
some people and entire agencies that I would love to see be part of
the McCann family." Mr. Dooner declines to identify possible
acquisitions.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Dooner is just gearing up for the headaches of running one of
the largest world-wide agencies. (There are no immediate plans to
replace Mr. Dooner as president; Mr. James operated as chairman,
chief executive officer and president for a period of time.) Mr.
James is filled with thoughts of enjoying his three hobbies:
sailing, skiing and hunting.
</p>
<p>
   Asked why he would choose to voluntarily exit while he still is
so young, Mr. James says it is time to be a tad selfish about how he
spends his days. Mr. James, who has a reputation as an
extraordinarily tough taskmaster, says that because he "had a great
time" in advertising," he doesn't want to "talk about the
disappointments." In fact, when he is asked his opinion of the new
batch of Coke ads from CAA, Mr. James places his hands over his
mouth. He shrugs. He doesn't utter a word. He has, he says, fond
memories of working with Coke executives. "Coke has given us great
highs," says Mr. James, sitting in his plush office, filled with
photographs of sailing as well as huge models of, among other
things, a Dutch tugboat.
</p>
<p>
   He says he feels a "great sense of accomplishment." In 36
countries, McCann is ranked in the top three; in 75 countries, it is
in the top 10.
</p>
<p>
   Soon, Mr. James will be able to compete in as many sailing races
as he chooses. And concentrate on his duties as rear commodore at
the New York Yacht Club.
</p>
<p>
   Maybe he'll even leave something from his office for Mr. Dooner.
Perhaps a framed page from the New York Times, dated Dec. 8, 1987,
showing a year-end chart of the stock market crash earlier that
year. Mr. James says he framed it and kept it by his desk as a
"personal reminder. It can all be gone like that."

@  Viacom Names Team to Consolidate
@  Assets of Paramount and Blockbuster

<p>
   Viacom Inc., embarking on the daunting task of
combining three companies, announced a "transition" management team
that will consolidate the assets of recently acquired Paramount
Communications Inc. and those of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.
after the completion of Viacom's separate merger with Blockbuster.
</p>
<p>
   Viacom said the transition team will include two of its
executives and one from Paramount, all of whom will report to Viacom
President and Chief Executive Frank Biondi, 49 years old. Viacom
General Counsel Philippe P. Dauman, 40, will become executive vice
president and chief administrative officer, while Thomas E. Dooley,
37, who heads Viacom's corporate development, will become executive
vice president of finance, corporate development and communications.
</p>
<p>
   As reported, Paramount Chairman Martin Davis and President
Stanley Jaffe will leave their executive posts, though Mr. Davis is
working informally on the management transition, a Paramount
spokesman said. Paramount's formal representative on the transition
team is Ronald L. Nelson, 41, executive vice president and chief
financial officer. Whether he will have a longer-term role at the
merged companies and what it will be haven't been determined, though
Viacom executives say they want to keep him at the company.
</p>
<p>
   The Blockbuster merger is expected to be voted on by its
shareholders in May; if it is completed, Blockbuster President and
Chief Operating Officer Steven R. Berrard, 39, will join the
transition team.
</p>
<p>
   Viacom, which acquired Paramount for nearly $10 billion after a
five-month bidding contest with QVC Inc., is swallowing two
companies considerably larger than itself; Paramount has some 12,500
employees to Viacom's 5,000. Blockbuster, meanwhile, has close to
40,000 employees, mostly in its retail stores nationwide.
</p>
<p>
   Though Viacom officials decline to discuss layoffs, Wall Street
analysts expect the company, now heavily laden with debt, to sharply
cut staffing levels in such areas as television distribution, where
the three companies combined have four different overlapping units.
John Tinker, an analyst at Furman Selz, said he expects Viacom
management to take $250 million in pretax restructuring charges that
include staff cutbacks in corporate and operations areas.
</p>
<p>
   During the bidding contest for Paramount, Viacom's advisers at
Smith Barney Shearson said Viacom expected annual cost savings of
$200 million at the minimum from, among other things, "elimination
of duplicate television production, distribution and sales" and
savings on overhead and administration costs.
</p>
<p>
   Speculation about cutbacks and executive changes has been rampant
at Paramount's Hollywood studio, where Mr. Biondi and Viacom
Chairman Sumner Redstone recently had a week of intensive meetings.
Later, at the annual gathering of theatrical exhibitors in Las
Vegas, Paramount Pictures studio chief Sherry Lansing made reference
in a speech to the "turmoil" the studio has endured recently.
Following her at the podium, Mr. Redstone told the audience, "the
turmoil is just beginning."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Dauman and others at Paramount who attended the session said
Mr. Redstone's remarks were made in a jesting manner, and noted that
Mr. Redstone went on to make a number of positive remarks about the
studio. Mr. Biondi told the same gathering that Ms. Lansing and her
motion picture team "is our team," and he said yesterday that Ms.
Lansing has agreed to stay on.
</p>
<p>
   Still unclear is whether Viacom will name an executive to oversee
Paramount's entertainment operations, which include the studio, TV
operations, theatrical exhibition, theme parks and Madison Square
Garden. Mr. Biondi declined to comment, although he acknowledged the
company is examining that option.

<HL>    Two Top Woolworth Officers Step Down
@  Amid Probe of Accounting Irregularities
@  ----
@  By Patrick M. Reilly
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> 04/04/94 </DD>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   The chairman and the chief financial officer of
Woolworth Corp. have temporarily relinquished their posts while the
retailer conducts its investigation into alleged accounting
irregularities.
</p>
<p>
   Woolworth's board named John W. Adams, an outside director, to
serve as interim chairman and chief executive officer while a
special committee, appointed by the board last week and led by Mr.
Adams, investigates the alleged irregularities. Mr. Adams, 69 years
old, is the retired chairman of Canadian-based Emco Ltd., a maker of
plumbing and petroleum equipment; he has served on the Woolworth
board since 1981.
</p>
<p>
   In a statement yesterday, Woolworth said William K. Lavin,
chairman and chief executive, and Charles T. Young, chief financial
officer, stepped down voluntarily on a "temporary basis pending
conclusion" of the investigation.
</p>
<p>
   Messrs. Lavin and Young "deny any wrongdoing" and told the
company "the sole reason for their action is to permit Woolworth to
conduct business as usual" while the investigation proceeds, the
statement said. Mr. Lavin didn't return telephone calls seeking
comment; Mr. Young couldn't be reached for comment. The company said
it expects to name an interim chief financial officer soon.
</p>
<p>
   While the company hasn't commented on the probe, persons close to
the board said that Messrs. Lavin and Young, along with some other
top Woolworth executives, were under investigation by the special
committee for their possible involvement in the alleged
irregularities. The committee is focusing on whether Woolworth
executives knowingly reported inaccurate gross profit margins in at
least three of the company's quarterly reports during the fiscal
year ended Jan. 29. Gross margin is the difference between what the
retailer sold merchandise for and what it actually paid for it, and
is an important component used in calculating a company's net
income.
</p>
<p>
   The committee hired the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton
& Garrison and accountant KPMG Peat Marwick to assist in the
investigation. The Paul Weiss partner in charge of the
investigation, Mark A. Belnick, is expected to make a report of the
investigation to Mr. Adams's special committee in six to eight
weeks.
</p>
<p>
   Woolworth has provided few details about the alleged
irregularities, except to say they will cause the retailer to
restate its quarterly results for the last fiscal year, reflecting
the "correction of gross margins." The company has said the
restatements aren't expected to have an impact on the full-year
results. The quarters affected are the first, second and third of
the last fiscal year. People close to the board said the
inaccuracies were corrected during the fourth quarter.
</p>
<p>
   Though the board has been told the margin discrepancies are
modest -- in one quarter the gross margin was misstated by about $16
million -- the board has learned the inaccurate gross margin numbers
probably led Woolworth to report moderate interim after-tax profit
rather than moderate after-tax losses for at least two quarters in
the past fiscal year, according to people familiar with
investigation.
</p>
<p>
   Woolworth, which had revenue last year of close to $10 billion,
is now concerned the news of alleged irregularities could damage its
relationship with suppliers and retail-credit companies. In its
statement yesterday, Woolworth said it reassured several of its
"key" suppliers that the events of the past week won't have any
"material adverse impact on Woolworth's financial position." The
company added that none of the major suppliers contacted "has
indicated that it won't continue to ship to the company." The
statement followed reports in this and other newspapers last week
that several factoring companies and credit services had told
suppliers to hold shipments to Woolworth until details of the
investigation could be learned.
</p>
<p>
   "The allegations have to be put to bed. It's hurting the
company," said a person close to the board. "The credibility
question has to be dealt with." A Woolworth board member, speaking
independently, said, "The company is clean and strong financially,
but this has been a real shakeup."
</p>
<p>
   According to people close to the board, Mr. Adams, who is also
chairman of the board's audit committee, learned of the quarterly
inaccuracies from a "high-level manager" at Woolworth's Manhattan
headquarters in late February. After inquiries, Mr. Adams learned
the allegations had "some substance," the people said. Mr. Adams
then called in the company's standing outside auditor, Price
Waterhouse, and Peat Marwick, to each go over the company's
quarterly statements. Over the weekend of March 26, the two
accounting firms concurred that "sufficient discrepancies" existed
to require a restatement of the company's quarterly numbers for at
least the last fiscal year. Mr. Adams couldn't be reached for
comment.
</p>
<p>
   Though the investigation has barely begun, persons close to the
board said Messrs. Lavin and Young will get a "hard look" as to
whether they were involved, and are both considered a "natural
focus" of the inquiry. The persons added that the investigation will
also include any top Woolworth executives who "had knowledge or
involvement in the reporting of the quarterly numbers."
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, Mr. Lavin and other company executives, are named in a
number of shareholder suits filed late last week in federal court in
Manhattan. Mr. Lavin was Woolworth's chief financial officer for
several years until July 1, 1993, when he was named chairman and
chief executive.
</p>
<p>
   One suit claims Mr. Lavin had access to "adverse" information and
"knew, or was grossly reckless in not knowing, of the fraud
alleged." The suit claims Mr. Lavin acted to "conceal adverse
material information" regarding Woolworth's finances in an effort to
"increase and maintain an artificially high market price for the
common stock of Woolworth."
</p>
<p>
   Other suits charge Woolworth executives and directors sold stock
at prices above last Wednesday's closing price and before the
alleged irregularities came to light. Woolworth shares closed Friday
at $15.125, ending the week down 21%. The shares have plummeted 40%
since Dec. 31.
</p>
<p>
   The investigation follows a wrenching period for Woolworth, whose
origins date back to 1879. Woolworth, attempting to pare away
unprofitable businesses, has spent the past two years selling off
and closing hundreds of its Woolworth variety stores, Kinney shoe
stores, and its Woolco store operation in Canada. The company has
been forced to liquidate many stores and has taken losses reflecting
markdowns, a process some board members believe may have contributed
to reporting inaccurate gross margin numbers.
</p>
<p>
   Board members are mystified as to why executives would knowingly
submit or approve inaccurate gross margins numbers since they have
no connection to executives' compensation, stock-buying plans, or
any other incentives. Executives can earn cash bonuses, but only
based on pretax profit goals determined from year-end audited
results.
</p>
<p>
   "There is no evidence that any of them would have gained
personally from this, or get any advantage," said one board member.
"That's what adds to the mystery here."

   Carl Sagan, the noted astronomer, is a funny
man. Just ask his wife:
</p>
<p>
   "A laugh a minute," she says.
</p>
<p>
   Other people he doesn't always find so amusing. For example: He
does not consider himself a Butt-Head Astronomer, and those who have
intimated that he is have been hauled into court. Sued, by unsmiling
lawyers.
</p>
<p>
   This all began a few months ago. Nerds over at Apple Computer
Inc. were putting together some new computer models. Customarily,
Apple gives these machines secret code names during development, and
real names when they are ready to be sold to the public. Code-naming
is considered an honor. "You pick a name of someone you . . .
respect," explains Mark Macgillivray, a California computer
consultant.
</p>
<p>
   Apple has had computers in the works named after George Gershwin
and Charles Lindbergh. And more recently, somebody plucked out Dr.
Sagan as a code-name honoree. The nerds reportedly jested: Maybe the
name would be lucky, propelling the computers to sales of "billions
and billions." Dr. Sagan, of course, is known for his TV programs
about celestial events "billions and billions of years ago."
</p>
<p>
   Somebody wrote about this in a computer magazine. But when Dr.
Sagan, a Cornell University professor, learned of the purported
honor, he didn't laugh. His lawyers wrote Apple to complain that
this was an illegal usurpation of his name for commercial purposes.
Fine, said Apple.
</p>
<p>
   But the nerds were more mischievous. They changed the code name,
all right. To the abbreviation BHA. When inquiring minds asked what
this meant, they supposedly were told: "Butt-Head Astronomer."
</p>
<p>
   This traveled at light speed to the 59-year-old astronomer. He
sued Apple last week in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The suit
contends that calling Dr. Sagan a "Butt-Head Astronomer" is
"defamatory on its face" and has subjected him to "hatred, contempt,
ridicule and obloquy." He is seeking unspecified damages. Dr. Sagan
wasn't available and his lawyer declined to comment. Apple won't,
either, though a spokesman -- contrary to previous accounts -- says
the BHA designation that replaced the Sagan code name was "randomly
chosen."
</p>
<p>
   Some lawyers expect Dr. Sagan's suit to flame out. It is doubtful
that an unofficial code name is a commercial use of his name, they
say. And, under recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings on libel, it is
unlikely that "butt-head" will be seen as defamatory, says Kevin
Baine, a Washington lawyer. "If you refer to someone as a butt-head,
ordinarily speaking, no one is going to take that as any specific
charge of any improper conduct or insinuation of any character
trait," he says.
</p>
<p>
   A big question, Mr. Baine says, that would have to be answered at
trial: What exactly is a butt-head, anyway? As portrayed by the
demonic characters on MTV's "Beavis and Butt-head" cartoon series, a
butt-head is a wise-cracking lout. Not so, says Laid Back
Enterprises in Oklahoma City, which claims a trademark on an amiable
cartoon character named "Butthead." "We consider our Butthead to be
an endearing, fun-loving guy," a spokesman says.

<p>
   Aviall Inc., Dallas, expects to report first-quarter earnings
roughly in the middle range of analysts' forecasts of five to 10
cents a share.
</p>
<p>
   No comparable per-share figures from a year earlier are available
because the aviation-services company was a unit of Ryder System
Inc. until December, when it was spun off. In the year-earlier
quarter, the company had profit of $1 million on sales of $214.5
million, including a $4.9 million charge for an accounting change.
</p>
<p>
   For the first half, President and Chief Executive Officer
Marshall B. Taylor said results will be down because the company has
less work in progress than it did a year earlier. He also cited
competitive pricing.
</p>
<p>
   But Mr. Taylor said the company is "looking at a strong second
half." Aviall has some price increases due in the second half, and
the company recently renewed or extended engine-overhaul contracts
with its four biggest customers.
