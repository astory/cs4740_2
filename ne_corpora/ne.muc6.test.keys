<TXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consuela Washington</ENAMEX>, a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> staffer and
an expert in securities laws, is a leading candidate to be
chairwoman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX>, 44 years old, would be the first woman and the
first black to head the five-member commission that oversees the
securities markets.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX>'s candidacy is being championed by several
powerful lawmakers including her boss, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> (D.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX>. She currently is
a counsel to the committee. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> have been
considered allies of the securities exchanges, while banks and
futures exchanges have often fought with them.
</p>
<p>
   A graduate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Law School</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX> worked as a
laywer for the corporate finance division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> in the late
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</TIMEX>. She has been a congressional staffer since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> transition officials said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Newman</ENAMEX>,
50, vice chairman and chief financial officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BankAmerica Corp.</ENAMEX>,
is expected to be nominated as assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary for
domestic finance. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newman</ENAMEX>, who would be giving up a job that pays
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> a year, would oversee the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s auctions of
government securities as well as banking issues. He would report
directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary-designate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX>, who headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> for the past
six years, also is expected to nominate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Sessions</ENAMEX>, the
committee's chief tax counsel, to one of the top tax jobs at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   As early as today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> camp is expected to name five
undersecretaries of state and several assistant secretaries. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter
Tarnoff</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration official and president of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council on Foreign Relations</ENAMEX>, is expected to be named
undersecretary for political affairs. Former Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Wirth</ENAMEX> is
expected to get a newly created undersecretary post for global
affairs, which would include refugees, drugs and environmental
issues. Earlier, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Colorado</ENAMEX> Democrat had been a leading contender
to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Spero</ENAMEX>, an executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American
Express Co.</ENAMEX>, is a leading candidate for undersecretary for economic
affairs. And Time magazine columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strobe Talbott</ENAMEX> is to be named
ambassador-at-large to coordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy toward the former
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Several appointees of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> are likely to stay in office
at least temporarily, until permanent successors can be named. One
is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernadine Healy</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>.
Another likely holdover is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Kessler</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug
Administration</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   In the offfice of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative-designate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey
Kantor</ENAMEX>, selections for the three deputy trade representative slots
and general counsel are still to be decided. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kyle</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX>'s trade counsel, is considered a top
candidate for one of the slots or for a trade post elsewhere in the
government.
</p>
<p>
   For many subcabinet jobs, the list of candidates has been
narrowed considerably. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> officials are said to be deciding
between recently retired Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew McHugh</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>) and
environmental activist and transition official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gus Speth</ENAMEX> for the
director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency for International Development</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Among others expected to be hired include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitty Higgins</ENAMEX>, an aide
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sander Levin</ENAMEX>, as chief of staff in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor
Department</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Palast</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Employees
International Union</ENAMEX> is expected to be the department's director of
legislative affairs.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, the incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration is seriously
considering moving the briefing room for the press, for decades
situated in the West Wing of the White House, out of the White House
and into the Old Executive Office Building next door. The current
briefing room could be used for staff offices.

<TXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> confirmed his interest in
buying back the ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">New York Post</ENAMEX>. But analysts said that if he
winds up bidding for the paper, he faces a no-win situation in the
overcrowded <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> newspaper market.
</p>
<p>
   While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> appears to have the money to keep the paper
going, investing in a troubled newspaper would seem at odds with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s current strategic moves away from newspapers and into
electronic news and information delivery, industry analysts said.
They also said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX> may not survive long enough for Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> to get the necessary approval to buy the paper, which he
owned from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Purcell</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News America
Publishing</ENAMEX> unit, said yesterday, "We have been asked by various
public officials if we would consider taking a look at it, and we
are." He added, "Newspapers are something he Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> loves. I
don't think he has ever lost interest in them."
</p>
<p>
   But at issue is whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> can overcome federal
regulations that would prevent him from bidding for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX>. Under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> regulations prohibiting
crossownership, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> is barred from owning both a newspaper
and television station in the same market. After Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> bought
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX>, he acquired local television station <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">WNYW-TV</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, and
he was forced to sell the paper two years later.
</p>
<p>
   With some political maneuvering, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> could be granted a
waiver from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> that would allow him to own the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox
Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> network affiliate. "The cross-ownership issue is a
concern," Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purcell</ENAMEX> conceded. "If there were an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> waiver, we
would consider buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX>."
</p>
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> bid would compete with businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham Hirschfeld</ENAMEX>
who has an option to buy the unprofitable paper.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">The Post</ENAMEX>, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-protection,
is estimated to have losses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> a year under its current
owner, real estate developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Kalikow</ENAMEX>; is losing circulation,
and faces increased competition from a rejuvenated New York Daily
News. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purcell</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX> "a tough
financial situation."
</p>
<p>
   Analysts were puzzled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s new interest in the paper.
"I just don't get it. I don't know what sort of synergy it
represents" said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Reif</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> continued its executive
makeover by hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome B. York</ENAMEX>, an architect of the turnaround at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>, to become chief financial officer.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX>, 54 years old, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Point</ENAMEX> graduate who helped
transform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> by slashing costs and selling billions of dollars
in assets. His appointment is a strong sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s new chairman,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis V. Gerstner Jr.</ENAMEX>, plans a similar strategy at the wounded
computer giant.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> raced to hire Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> after meeting him for the
first time just three weeks ago in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> offices. In his
first month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> has also brought in outsiders to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s
communications and disk-drive business, and is searching for a new
head of personnel.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> was executive vice president for finance and a board
member at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, where he spent 12 years in financial posts and
running several car and truck divisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> didn't name a
successor yesterday. While it may look outside the company, it has
several inside candidates.
</p>
<p>
   A lean, intense man with a piercing stare, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> was known at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> for his obsessive work hours, especially during the auto
maker's near-collapse in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   "At one meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, I turned to him to make a presentation
and he said, `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>, you better handle this, I don't feel so good.'
Then he passed out and security guys had to come take him away on a
stretcher," recalled former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert S. "Steve"
Miller</ENAMEX>. "It was just exhaustion from too many all-nighters, too much
coffee and cigarettes instead of the old sustenance."
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s selection of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> was first reported by USA Today.
</p>
<p>
   At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> will face what he yesterday called "the most
challenging situation of this era." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> had losses of nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5
billion</NUMEX> last year and saw its stock price cut in half amid the nose
dive of its mainframe computer business.
</p>
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s balance sheet and core finances have remained stable,
it has lost much credibility on Wall Street and has been stripped of
its prized triple-A credit rating. Its longtime chief financial
officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Metz</ENAMEX>, took early retirement in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> executive
shake-up that also pushed aside ex-chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Akers</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> will also be arriving at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> amid charges by some
financial experts that the company is too aggressive about reporting
revenue that it may never actually get through complex sales
gimmicks and a rare leasing maneuver. In an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 7</TIMEX> Wall Street
Journal article, several experts suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s accounting
grew much more liberal since the mid-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX> as its business turned
sour. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> adamantly disputes these charges.
</p>
<p>
   In an interview yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> wouldn't yet commit himself
to cost-cutting or any other specific strategy.
</p>
<p>
   "Reading the published financial data, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s costs don't appear
to me to be out of control," he said. "But on the other hand, if the
revenue side of the equation does not come back to former levels,
then probably there's going to have to be some reductions on the
cost side."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> led the effort to control costs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> in the late
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX>, when, for the second time in a decade, the car giant faced a
financial crisis. With outdated products and bloated overhead,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s earnings plunged from an operating profit of more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1
billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> to an operating loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$538 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   The company's unfunded pension liability soared and its credit
rating dropped below junk levels. Some analysts were predicting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s demise as an independent auto maker.
</p>
<p>
   In response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> cut in half the time and money invested in
new car lines and wrung savings from cooperating more with
suppliers. It also pumped money into new products, including the
high-profile Neon, a small car it says it spent only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.3 billion</NUMEX> to
develop.
</p>
<p>
   The result was that last year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> reported net of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$723
million</NUMEX>, the only Big Three auto maker to turn a profit. Its stock
has also soared from around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> a share just two years ago. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New
York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, it was quoted at
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$42.125</NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">87.5 cents</NUMEX> a share.
</p>
<p>
   Early this year Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> through one of the largest
stock sales ever for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> industrial company, raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.78
billion</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> is using most of the proceeds to reduce its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.4
billion</NUMEX> unfunded pension liability.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> wouldn't discuss his compensation package, which
could easily reach into seven figures. The subject is sensitive at a
time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is running big losses and laying off thousands of
employees. At last week's annual meeting, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> faced angry
questions about his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.5 million</NUMEX> annual salary and bonus.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> last year paid Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$414,167</NUMEX> in salary, a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300,000</NUMEX>
bonus and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$327,621</NUMEX> in long-term compensation based on quality
improvements in the company's products. By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> paid Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metz</ENAMEX>, its former chief financial officer, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$725,000</NUMEX> last
year.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> also had stock options that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.9
million</NUMEX> at the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. Normally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> would be expected to give
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> a one-time payment to cover the options he leaves behind.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> launched its search for a financial officer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, two
months before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> arrived. With Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akers</ENAMEX> a lame duck, vice
chairman and acting CFO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rizzo</ENAMEX> ran the search.
</p>
<p>
   After Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> took over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1</TIMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rizzo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russell
Reynolds Associates</ENAMEX> search consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Hart</ENAMEX> presented the new
chairman with five finalists. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> chose to interview only
two: Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> and another executive who wasn't identified.
</p>
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> shares were quoted at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$49.25</NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">62.5
cents</NUMEX>, but analysts said the rise wasn't connected to the hiring of
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> had been a dark-horse candidate to succeed
departing chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee A. Iacocca</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> ultimately chose former
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Eaton</ENAMEX>. The succession struggle
left relations somewhat strained between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lutz</ENAMEX>, who had been another contender for the top
job.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX>'s subordinates would report temporarily to
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eaton</ENAMEX>. Candidates from within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> to succeed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX>
include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary C. Valade</ENAMEX>, human resources chief; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas P. Capo</ENAMEX>,
treasurer; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas W. Sidlik</ENAMEX>, vice president for customer
satisfaction and quality.
</p>
<p>
   After graduating from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Point</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">York</ENAMEX> got a masters in
structural engineering from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of
Technology</ENAMEX> and an M.B.A. at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan</ENAMEX>. A native of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, he said he spends his spare time working as a
"gentleman farmer" and hunting deer, elk, and antelope.

   We read where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton White House</ENAMEX> is seeking a deputy to
chief of staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mack McLarty</ENAMEX> to impose some disciplined coherence on
the place's rambunctious young staff. What's her name? Quite
seriously, the names mentioned as possibilities were three male
apparatchiks from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Beltway</ENAMEX>'s Democratic political machine. Are we
supposed to conclude from this that it's OK to let "diversity" put
women in high visibility jobs, but that when the administration
needs to actually get something done and crack heads, the job has to
go to a male pol? The symbolism would be unfortunate.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael D. Casey</ENAMEX>, a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson & Johnson</ENAMEX>
manager, moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic Therapy Inc.</ENAMEX>, a small biotechnology
concern here, to become its president and chief operating officer.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX>, 46 years old, was president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J&J</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McNeil
Pharmaceutical</ENAMEX> subsidiary, which was merged with another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J&J</ENAMEX> unit,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.</ENAMEX>, this year in a cost-cutting move.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. James Barrett</ENAMEX>, 50, as president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic
Therapy</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett</ENAMEX> remains chief executive officer and becomes
chairman.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> said he made the move to the smaller company because he
saw health care moving toward technologies like the company's gene
therapy products. "I believe that the field is emerging and is
prepared to break loose," he said.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> declined to divulge his compensation, which he said was
comparable to his package at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J&J</ENAMEX>, but acknowledged that the equity
portion was higher at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic Therapy</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Noting other recent moves by pharmaceutical executives to small
biotech companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T.W. Hawkins</ENAMEX>, the executive recruiter who
arranged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic Therapy</ENAMEX> placement, said, "The equity play is
obviously the draw for many of these executives in evaluating small
and emerging companies." But, he added, "fundamentally, it's the
excitement and challenge of building an emerging pharmaceutical
company" that attracts the executives.

<TXT>
<p>
   A group of top corporate executives urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
to pass President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s deficit-reduction plan, declaring that
it is superior to the only apparent alternative: more gridlock.
</p>
<p>
   "There are things in the president's plan that I don't like and
things that aren't in there that I'd like to see," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen
Wolf</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>. "But, on balance,
it's a significant step forward."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>, whose sentiments were widely shared by his colleagues,
joined 68 other executives who lunched with the president and then
assembled in the East Room of the White House in a show of support
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> program.
</p>
<p>
   The meeting went far beyond Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s normal weekly gathering
of business leaders. Economic adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Sperling</ENAMEX> described it as
"a true full-court press" to pass the deficit-reduction bill, the
final version of which is now being hammered out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
negotiators.
</p>
<p>
   The executives' backing -- however tepid -- gives the
administration a way to counter business critics of the overall
package, while providing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> more levers to
win over reluctant lawmakers. Both parties are using business
leaders as proxies of sorts to put pressure on swing votes in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, and there has been sometimes intense
behind-the-scenes maneuvering to win, or block, endorsements from
CEOs.
</p>
<p>
   By having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethlehem Steel Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank Barnette</ENAMEX> turn up
in the East Room, for example, Democrats are in a stronger position
to win over Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul McHale</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> freshman from the
steelmaker's home town who voted against the deficit package when it
first passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   The executives "are here, just as I am, not because any one
agrees with every last line and jot and tittle of this economic
program," Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> acknowledged, but "because it does far more
good than harm."
</p>
<p>
   Despite resistance from some lawmakers in his own party, the
president predicted the bill would pass. "The atmosphere in
discussions here is not as bad as -- if anything, it's a little
better than -- it was before the initial votes were taken in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>," he said. At that time, the package barely
cleared both chambers; Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s vote was needed to
snap a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> tie.
</p>
<p>
   Some of the executives who attended yesterday's session weren't a
surprise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenneco Inc.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Walsh</ENAMEX>, for instance, is a
staunch Democrat who provided an early endorsement for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
during the presidential campaign. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul
Allaire</ENAMEX> was one of the few top corporate chief executive officers
who contributed money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> campaign. And others, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lodwrick M. Cook</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zenith
Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Pearlman</ENAMEX>, have also previously
voiced their approval of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s economic strategy.
</p>
<p>
   But some faces were fresh. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Augustine</ENAMEX>, the chairman of
defense contractor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Marietta Corp.</ENAMEX>, is a registered Republican
who has never stood behind Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. It was also the first formal
show of support by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rand Araskog</ENAMEX>, the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX>
</p>
<p>
   Among those who also attended yesterday's gathering were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwayne
Andreas</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archer Daniels Midland Co.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodney Chase</ENAMEX>,
president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP America Inc.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Hall</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citgo
Petroleum Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix Rohatyn</ENAMEX>, a partner with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Johnson</ENAMEX>, chairman
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Publishing Co.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Burt</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMC Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray
Irani</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental Petroleum Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Marron</ENAMEX>,
chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PaineWebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. MacAllister Booth</ENAMEX>, chairman
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polaroid Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Smithburg</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaker Oats Co.</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deryck Maughan</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Carroll</ENAMEX>,
president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell Oil Co.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campbell</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Co.</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheryl Handler</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thinking Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>; and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Levin</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>
</p>
<p>
   Some of the executives also signed letters on behalf of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> program. Nearly all of them praised the president for his
efforts to pare the deficit.
</p>
<p>
   "This is not necessarily the package I would design," said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin
Marietta</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustine</ENAMEX>. "But we have to attack the deficit."

   The departure of the matriarch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> publishing empire
came as little surprise to media analysts, who have been
anticipating Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>'s ascent to the top spot. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>, 76

</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>, 48, will remain the company's chief executive officer

</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan G. Spoon</ENAMEX>, 42, will succeed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> as president of the

<p>
   After much melodrama, media baron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> once
again owns the ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">New York Post</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>,
completed his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> purchase of the bankrupt tabloid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>,
after threatening twice in recent months to cancel the purchase over
labor disputes. He was lured back last week by promises from nine
craft unions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX> that they wouldn't honor a strike by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newspaper Guild</ENAMEX>, and once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s paper was published without
disruption, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> closed the deal.
</p>
<p>
   Without support from the other unions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guild</ENAMEX>, which
represents nearly 300 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX>'s 700 employees, voted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> to
end its strike. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guild</ENAMEX> members have been invited to reapply for their
old jobs today, though it is assumed that dozens of them won't be
rehired.
</p>
<p>
   Despite his labor victory, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> faces major obstacles in
turning around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX>, which has had losses of about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 million</NUMEX> a
year. With the disruptions of multiple owners, bankruptcy and the
retailing recession, both circulation and advertising have fallen
sharply since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> last owned the paper, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>.
Circulation alone has fallen to about 400,000 from one million a
decade ago. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Post</ENAMEX> has to compete with two other deep-pocket
tabloid owners, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortimer B. Zuckerman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s Daily News, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Mirror Co.</ENAMEX>, which publishes New York Newsday.
</p>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Foods Co.</ENAMEX>, already the country's leading processor of
private-label frozen vegetables, agreed to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX>
frozen vegetables brand from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX>
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$140 million</NUMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   If approved by federal regulators -- both the company and
industry analysts say they expect no opposition -- the acquisition
would nearly double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>'s vegetable sales and give it the broadest
array of products in the marketplace as well as the oldest name in
the frozen category.
</p>
<p>
   The acquisition would more than double <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>'s annual sales of
frozen vegetables, to about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$460 million</NUMEX>, and increase the company's
portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.6 billion</NUMEX> processed-vegetables market to
nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> from about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" ALT="May 30">the year ended May 30</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> reported
vegetable sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$347 million</NUMEX>, or about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.3 billion</NUMEX>
total sales. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> is the nation's second-largest dairy, behind
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden Inc.</ENAMEX>
</p>
<p>
   "They offer us all kinds of new blends and value-added products
we're not doing," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Dean</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franklin Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, company, said of the acquisition. "We think it
complements our line very well and gives us a great national brand."
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> hasn't been successful in marketing prepared frozen
vegetables in ready-to-heat sauces, a category in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX>
has numerous offerings. While the market for plain sliced-and-diced
vegetables has been flat, the one for so-called value-added
products, which also includes vegetables with pasta, is growing.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>'s major brands include Veg-All canned vegetables and
Freshlike, a frozen and canned line sold primarily in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> said last month it was considering selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX>, the
No. 2 frozen-vegetables brand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Metropolitan
PLC</ENAMEX>'s Green Giant. At the time a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> executive, explaining the
decision, said, "You can be either really big and develop
significant economies of scale or you can be very focused and go
after segments that are attractive. Where you don't want to be is
somewhere in the middle."
</p>
<p>
   Without a canned line, and bruised in the commodity-like plain
vegetables market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX> was more susceptible to economic
swings. Lately the vegetable market has been hit by flooding and
fickle consumers. Moreover, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX> processed only about
one-third of the vegetables it sells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> handles crops from field
to supermarket shelf. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birds Eye</ENAMEX> acquisition also includes a
small frozen-fruit business.
</p>
<p>
   Investors like the prospects. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>'s stock jumped about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> on the
news to close at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$27.125</NUMEX>, up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.50</NUMEX>, in composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock
Exchange</ENAMEX> trading.
</p>
<p>
   "It definitely makes sense," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ravi Sadarangani</ENAMEX>, food analyst
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William Blair & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. Buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX> reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>'s
earnings volatility "because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> has traditionally been in the
private-label segment, where prices are more susceptible to
commodity cycles." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX>'s premium products aren't as vulnerable
to such fluctuations, he said.
</p>
<p>
   Food analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Dahlman</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper, Jaffray</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>
said, "This is a time in the vegetable industry for financially
strong and smart companies to get in deeper. The industry is at a
cyclical bottom so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> is doubly leveraged to take advantage of
recovery."
</p>
<p>
   The acquisition would include three plants, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>'s processing facilities to 18. Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX> said the company intends to retain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birds Eye</ENAMEX>'s production,
sales and distribution force, but to pare some administration
personnel. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birds Eye</ENAMEX>, now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All-American Gourmet Co.</ENAMEX>,
is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, and has about 900 employees.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX> was among numerous bidders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Birds Eye</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever
NV</ENAMEX>, a Dutch company that recently acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Breyer</ENAMEX>'s ice cream
business from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHL Systemhouse Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX>, said it expects to report an
operating loss for its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal fourth quarter, ended Aug. 31</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   The computer-services company didn't indicate the size of the
anticipated loss. It attributed the shortfall partly to delays in
signing and starting work on major contracts.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systemhouse</ENAMEX> also said it expects to record a "major"
restructuring charge of more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">135 million Canadian dollars</NUMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX>$102.7 million</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   The company's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourth-quarter</TIMEX> financial results are due out at the
end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1992 fourth quarter</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systemhouse</ENAMEX> had a net
loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">C</ENAMEX>$7.4 million</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18 Canadian cents</NUMEX> a share, on revenue of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">C</ENAMEX>$190.4 million</NUMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systemhouse</ENAMEX> also said it appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Damp</ENAMEX>, 38 years old,
president and chief operating officer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damp</ENAMEX> was previously vice
chairman and chief financial officer. He will succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Burns</ENAMEX>,
46, who was appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systemhouse</ENAMEX>'s vice chairman with
responsibility for business development. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damp</ENAMEX> will continue to
serve as chief financial officer until a replacement is found.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal

in line with analysts' expectations.
</p>
<p>
   Net income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the period ended Dec. 26</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$43.8 million</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46

year earlier, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> was hit by product start-up costs and
shortages.
</p>
<p>
   Although the results were "a little lighter" than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">49 cents</NUMEX> a
share he hoped for, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Canin</ENAMEX> said he was
pleased with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s gross margins for the quarter, which were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX>, up
sharply from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX> a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
   Revenue rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.13 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.05 billion</NUMEX>, and back orders
reached record levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> cited high demand for new products,
especially its new servers, high-end ZX and SX graphics workstations
and Solaris software.
</p>
<p>
   Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lehman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s vice president and

   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Melia</ENAMEX> who is moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the East Coast</ENAMEX>

@  Blacks' Increasing Vocal Opposition to Violence
@  Is Matched by Strong Opposition to Crime Bill
@  ----
@  By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Davidson</ENAMEX>
@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>
<DD> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">01/27/94</TIMEX> </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16 </SO>
<DATELINE> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX> </DATELINE>
<TXT>
<p>
   The Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX>, the often fiery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rainbow
Coalition</ENAMEX> president, was subdued, reflective, nearly rhymeless.
</p>
<p>
   At a recent hearing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Black Caucus</ENAMEX> brain trust
on crime, he spoke solemnly, his voice breaking, of how some young
black men feel "more secure in jails than on our streets." With
tears in his eyes, he spoke of death in his own neighborhood here
and the precarious position of black youth. "Nearly half of all
murder victims are black," he said. "More blacks kill each other
each year than were killed in the entire history of lynching."
</p>
<p>
   Yet, the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> assailed one of the prime legislative
vehicles for dealing with that explosion of violence -- the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>-passed crime legislation that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> backed in his
State of the Union address. The measure, he declared, is an
"ill-conceived bill" and a "Draconian . . . expensive non-remedy."
</p>
<p>
   The bill has widespread bipartisan support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.
Lawmakers contend it represents the toughest and most comprehensive
government attack yet on violent crime, an issue at the top of the
public's list of concerns in opinion polls.
</p>
<p>
   But at a time when African-Americans increasingly are speaking
out against black criminals and the "gangsta rap" that seems to
glorify violence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Caucus</ENAMEX> and others say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bill is
too concerned with punishment, and not enough concerned with the
alleviation of the conditions that cause crime. The strong
opposition to the measure presents a problem for President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>,
whose support for the legislation places him at odds with a core
group of Democrats who elected him.
</p>
<p>
   Citing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s embrace of one provision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bill
-- mandatory life sentences for criminals convicted of three violent
felonies -- the dean of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Caucus</ENAMEX>, Democratic Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John
Conyers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>, decries the "lock-'em up and throw away the
key" approach that "only fools the public into believing that we're
doing something about crime."
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The White House</ENAMEX> will try to assuage at least some opponents'
concerns as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> undertakes to reconcile the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bill with a
much different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> measure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> officials, who were
criticized for not visibly exerting influence over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bill
last year, will play a more overt role in removing or modifying the
more extreme provisions this year. Deputy Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip
Heymann</ENAMEX> plans to testify at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> crime legislation hearings, and
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> himself held out the carrot of help to endangered youth
in his speech to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. "We have got to stop pointing our fingers
at these kids who have no future," he said, "and reach our hands out
to them."
</p>
<p>
   The question, though, is whether enough changes can be made to
the bill to soften opposition to it. In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black
Caucus</ENAMEX>, a range of others -- including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Conference of State
Legislators</ENAMEX> and many federal judges and prosecutors -- oppose
stringent sentencing provisions in the bill. Other less
controversial provisions in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$22.3 billion</NUMEX> legislation include
authorization for 100,000 additional police officers, drug treatment
and other crime-prevention programs.
</p>
<p>
   Some black leaders, such as the leadership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation of
Islam</ENAMEX>, have long spoken out against crime and for the kind of values
that make it unacceptable. But the mainstream civil-rights
leadership generally avoided the rhetoric of "law and order,"
regarding it as a code for keeping blacks back. Law and order didn't
mean justice, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> used to say, but "just us."
</p>
<p>
   In the past, many were hesitant to speak about crime in public
because "the larger community would talk about 'lock them up and
throw the key away' and hide behind black leaders in doing it,"
explains Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Washington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> Democrat who led the
caucus hearing.
</p>
<p>
   Now there is escalating discourse within the black community
about what it can and must do to stop crime. Just after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">the new
year</TIMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> held the first of several conferences focusing on
just that. "The premier civil-rights issue of this day is youth
violence in general and black-on-black violence in particular," he
has said. His conference also noted the structural conditions that
encourage crime -- the sorry state of the black economy, high
unemployment, poor education and a legacy of racism.
</p>
<p>
   "The black leaders recognize that if they don't step out front
and engage in the discussion, that basically our young people are
turning themselves into slaves," says Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX>. Within the
black community, there is "more public concern and debate about the
appropriate level of response to increasing crime and violence."
</p>
<p>
   Many of the black leaders involved in the growing debate retain
strong objections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bill, with its large number of
mandatory minimum sentences, death penalties and federalization of
local crimes.
</p>
<p>
   One of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> measures strongly opposed by most members of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Caucus</ENAMEX> has as its author one of its own, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>
Democratic Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Moseley-Braun</ENAMEX>. Her amendment would restrict
prosecutorial discretion -- a point opposed by Attorney General
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> -- by directing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorneys to prosecute as adults
13-year-olds charged with committing violent crimes with firearms.
</p>
<p>
   The provision would federalize many crimes currently prosecuted
by the states. Yet, notes federal Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maryanne Trump Barry</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, who is chairwoman of the criminal law committee of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judicial Conference of the U.S.</ENAMEX>, there is no federal juvenile
justice system to handle such cases -- no federal juvenile prisons,
for instance, and no federal youth probation officers.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The National Conference of State Legislatures</ENAMEX> is so opposed to
the federalization of state crimes -- another provision in the bill,
pushed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonse D'Amato</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, would federalize all
violent handgun crimes -- that it recently wrote President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
to say "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> bill is inimical to principles of federalism, and
we must oppose it." And a measure that would require states to adopt
certain federal sentencing guidelines, such as mandatory minimum
sentences, to get federal prison building funds is "coercive
policy," complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Felde</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCSL</ENAMEX>'s general counsel.
</p>
<p>
   There are numerous mandatory minimum provisions in the
legislation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX> fears could be used in an unfair
fashion against blacks who may be charged more harshly than whites
for similar acts. And federal judges have "consistently, vehemently,
and virtually unanimously opposed" mandatory minimum sentences,
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph
Biden</ENAMEX>, Democrat of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Other measures that caucus members say could be used in a
discriminatory way are those that would make it a federal crime to
conspire to participate in a criminal street gang and that provides
the death penalty for drug kingpins even if no death can be shown to
have resulted directly from their illegal activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Justice
Department</ENAMEX> has warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that it thinks the drugkingpin
provision is unconstitutional; the anti-gang measure will also be
hit on constitutional grounds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   But Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biden</ENAMEX> insists that the final legislation will include
enough significant prevention and punishment provisions that
liberals and conservatives alike will be able to endorse it. After
all, he says, "everybody is kind of singing from the same hymnal on
the broad strokes."

@  Law Firms Repackage Themselves
@  For High-Tech World of Multimedia
@
</p>
<p>
   THESE DAYS, it seems everybody wants to be a multimedia star.
</p>
<p>
   Lawyers, like others in the business of selling professional
services, are rushing to market themselves to the
telecommunications, computer and entertainment industries. Trouble
is, nobody agrees what it really means to be a multimedia lawyer. Or
an interactive law firm. Or whether there is such a thing as
practicing on the information superhighway.
</p>
<p>
   Some law firms touting their multimedia experts simply mean they
represent software companies in patent disputes. Other law firms do
regulatory and lobbying work for cable companies. And a few even try
to draw distinctions between information-superhighway lawyers, who
handle telecommunications work, and multimedia lawyers, who make
deals between high-tech and entertainment companies.
</p>
<p>
   Mostly though, law firms seem to apply these voguish labels to
whatever shape their practice happens to be taking at the moment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manatt, Phelps & Phillips of Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, whose clients include
movie stars and studios, brought in seven intellectual-property
lawyers from another firm in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> and immediately issued a news
release trumpeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manatt</ENAMEX>'s entrance into the "interactive and
multimedia arena." That arena, explains entertainment partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph
Horacek</ENAMEX>, is where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s "highest levels of talent" meet
computer executives.
</p>
<p>
   "I have called a number of large independent production companies
or studios, trying to educate them as between the two worlds," Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horacek</ENAMEX> says. The firm has yet to complete a single multimedia deal,
but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horacek</ENAMEX> says more than a dozen are in the works. Several
other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based firms have recently merged their
entertainment and intellectual-property departments.
@
</p>
<p>
   A FEW firms readily admit they're trying to lure clients into
uncharted legal territory. In promotional materials boasting about
its corporate and trademark-law work on behalf of a maker of
computer software for hospitals, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proskauer, Rose, Goetz &
Mendelsohn</ENAMEX> said it is entering the "precedent-less field of the
so-called information superhighway." Partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carole Handler</ENAMEX>, of the
firm's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> office, says the firm within a month will
establish a practice group made up of its attorneys in the
"high-tech, information superhighway area."
</p>
<p>
   For the 650-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro</ENAMEX>,
multimedia doesn't include an entertainment component per se but
instead seems to mean more frequent meetings between members of the
firm's intellectual property and telecommunications departments. The
firm's 15-member "media team," formed six months ago, also includes
antitrust and tax partners.
</p>
<p>
   "We're pulling together niches of our practice areas . . . to
market our multimedia experience and meet existing clients'
demands," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Cranston</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury</ENAMEX>'s telecommunications
practice. The media team is doing corporate work for units of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Telesis Group</ENAMEX>, a longstanding client of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury</ENAMEX>'s, and has
handled patent matters for computer companies.
</p>
<p>
   At a time when glamorous media deals like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX>'s
just-completed battle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> are all the
rage, no major law firm wants to be left behind. Like soft-drink
makers who put the same old stuff in new cans, law firms in many
instances are simply repackaging traditional legal functions such as
licensing and corporate finance.
</p>
<p>
   "This type of legal work has existed for a while," concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John
Valva</ENAMEX>, public-relations spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> law firm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farella, Braun & Martel</ENAMEX>. "It's just that all of a sudden, multimedia
is what it's called." But the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farella</ENAMEX>'s new "multimedia
practice group," partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Maximov</ENAMEX>, says that, "It's not enough
just to enhance your legal skills." Lawyers in his group have
attended university courses on such subjects as how to design video
games, he says.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s 450-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winston & Strawn</ENAMEX> formed its multimedia
practice group six months ago. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loren Wittner</ENAMEX>, partner in charge of
marketing, says the firm is following in the footsteps of major
accounting firms, which have organized themselves along
client-industry lines.
</p>
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Klemens</ENAMEX>, of the legal consulting firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altman Weil Pensa
Inc.</ENAMEX>, says that creating multidisciplinary teams may cause friction
over which traditional department is really controlling the client's
legal work.
@
</p>
<p>
   THE HYPE has many lawyers carping about their competitors'
claims. "Everybody has a slide in their presentation that says
`information superhighway' or `multimedia.' Then they mention three
clients, and no one's ever heard of them," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank Barry</ENAMEX>, partner
in charge of a 22-attorney "technology practice group" at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
Francisco</ENAMEX> law firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooley, Godward, Castro, Huddleson & Tatum</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   As a young lawyer, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> worked on movie deals at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
law firm. Now his clients are <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> start-up companies. "I
think there are probably only 10 lawyers in the country who can
legitimately say they've done major-league entertainment work and
major-league high-tech work," says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX>, who numbers himself
among them. He represented <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co.</ENAMEX> two years ago in its high-profile deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3DO Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountain
View</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, maker of interactive games and equipment, but says he
hasn't been involved in any multimedia transactions valued at more
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   What the brouhaha may boil down to is an attempt by big firms,
especially those that had lost market share to small
intellectual-property boutiques, to regain clients by claiming to
offer them one-stop shopping.
</p>
<p>
   Clients, however, may not be completely convinced. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hal Kruth</ENAMEX>,
vice president of law and business development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaleida Labs Inc.</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountain View</ENAMEX> software company, says he "can go to a patent lawyer
and hook them up with a very good corporate lawyer at another firm
and say, `Look, I want you guys to work together.'"
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kruth</ENAMEX> says he isn't taken in by trendy titles. When he wants
to hire a law firm, he looks for a strong record in a particular
area of the law. "There's no such thing as multimedia law," he says.
"What there is, is intellectual-property law, corporate law, and
contract work akin to entertainment-industry stuff. . . . It's still
the same basic legal skills."

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco Inc.</ENAMEX>, in a move to generate about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> in tax
deductions, said it induced five of its top executives to exercise
stock options to purchase about 3.6 million common shares of the
financial-services concern. As a result of the transaction, the
executives are about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> richer in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco</ENAMEX> shares.
</p>
<p>
   The company, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carmel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, also said that as an
inducement to exercise early their stock options, the officials --
its chief executive officer and four executive vice presidents --
received new options to buy 1.8 million shares at current market
prices. That figure equals the number of shares withheld to pay
federal and state taxes owed by the executives because of the deal.
The company actually issued the executives 1.8 million common
shares.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco</ENAMEX> said it plans to use the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> tax deduction to
offset taxable income, including the gain from the recent sale of
its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western National Corp.</ENAMEX>, the newly public parent
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western National Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> is
considered executive compensation and therefore is deductible by the
company.
</p>
<p>
   The five executives are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen C. Hilbert</ENAMEX>, chairman, president
and chief executive officer, and executive vice presidents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rollin M.
Dick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald F. Gongaware</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter T. Kirkbride</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence W.
Inlow</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco</ENAMEX> said that because of their exercised stock options,
its executives and directors own about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of the company's 26.3
million common shares outstanding, up from a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.7%</NUMEX> stake at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" ALT="1993">year-end
1993</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   A company spokesman said the average option price for the 3.6
million shares was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.70</NUMEX> a share. The options were granted between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.70</NUMEX>-a-share option price reflects two
2-for-1 stock splits, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco</ENAMEX> shares closed unchanged at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$56</NUMEX> in composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York
Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Fischer</ENAMEX>, publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, said
that while the shares exercised represent "a pretty good amount of
money," the arrangement isn't unusual. "It especially wasn't unusual
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> to have companies accelerating the vesting of options for
tax purposes," she said.
</p>
<p>
   Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX> also said that the withholding of shares to pay for
the executives' tax liabilities is a common feature of executive
stock-option plans. But she said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco</ENAMEX>'s granting of new
options to the executives -- so-called "reload" options, equal to
the number of shares used to pay taxes -- is a new feature that
companies have begun to put into stock-option plans the past few
years. "That reload option is an answer to critics who contend that
executives don't have enough ownership in their companies," she
said. The new options remain exercisable until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, which
was the exercise period available under the old options.
</p>
<p>
   In a related matter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco</ENAMEX> said it repurchased about 684,000
common shares from the marital estate of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilbert</ENAMEX> and his ex-wife
as part of the company's two million common-share buyback program
announced last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. The company said independent directors
authorized the repurchase to permit the settlement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilberts</ENAMEX>'
recent divorce proceeding without hurting the market for the stock.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilbert</ENAMEX> and the other four executives have no
intention to sell any shares in the foreseeable future.

<p>
   One of the many differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert L. James</ENAMEX>, chairman and
chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann-Erickson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Dooner Jr.</ENAMEX>,
the agency's president and chief operating officer, is quite
telling: Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> enjoys sailboating, while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> owns a
powerboat.
</p>
<p>
   Now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> is preparing to sail into the sunset, and Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> is poised to rev up the engines to guide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann-Erickson</ENAMEX> into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX> made
official what had been widely anticipated: Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, 57 years old,
is stepping down as chief executive officer on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1</TIMEX> and will
retire as chairman at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX>, 45.
</p>
<p>
   It promises to be a smooth process, which is unusual given the
volatile atmosphere of the advertising business. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> has
a big challenge that will be his top priority. "I'm going to focus
on strengthening the creative work," he says. "There is room to
grow. We can make further improvements in terms of the perception of
our creative work."
</p>
<p>
   Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Gottesman</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PaineWebber</ENAMEX>, who believes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX> is filled with "vitality" and is in "great shape," says that
from a creative standpoint, "You wouldn't pay to see their reel" of
commercials.
</p>
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX>'s world-wide billings rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.4 billion</NUMEX> last
year from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.7 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, the agency still is dogged by the
loss of the key creative assignment for the prestigious Coca-Cola
Classic account. "I would be less than honest to say I'm not
disappointed not to be able to claim creative leadership for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Coke</ENAMEX>,"
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> says.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX> still handles promotions and media buying for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>. But
the bragging rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Coke</ENAMEX>'s ubiquitous advertising belongs to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Artists Agency</ENAMEX>, the big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> talent agency. "We are
striving to have a strong renewed creative partnership with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>," Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> says. However, odds of that happening are
slim since word from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX> and
other ad agencies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fallon McElligott</ENAMEX>, will continue to
handle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> advertising.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX>, who recently lost 60 pounds over three-and-a-half
months, says now that he has "reinvented" himself, he wants to do
the same for the agency. For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX>, it means maintaining his
running and exercise schedule, and for the agency, it means
developing more global campaigns that nonetheless reflect local
cultures. One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX> account, "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," a
butter substitute, is in 11 countries, for example.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX> has initiated a new so-called global collaborative system,
composed of world-wide account directors paired with creative
partners. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Kim</ENAMEX> was hired from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.
Walter Thompson</ENAMEX> last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> as vice chairman, chief strategy
officer, world-wide.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> doesn't see a creative malaise permeating the agency.
He points to several campaigns with pride, including the Taster's
Choice commercials that are like a running soap opera. "It's a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19
million</NUMEX> campaign with the recognition of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> campaign,"
he says of the commercials that feature a couple that must hold a
record for the length of time dating before kissing.
</p>
<p>
   Even so, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> is on the prowl for more creative talent and
is interested in acquiring a hot agency. He says he would like to
finalize an acquisition "yesterday. I'm not known for patience."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Puris</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive
officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammirati & Puris</ENAMEX>, about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX>'s acquiring the agency
with billings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400 million</NUMEX>, but nothing has materialized. "There
is no question," says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX>, "that we are looking for quality
acquisitions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammirati & Puris</ENAMEX> is a quality operation. There are
some people and entire agencies that I would love to see be part of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX> family." Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> declines to identify possible
acquisitions.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> is just gearing up for the headaches of running one of
the largest world-wide agencies. (There are no immediate plans to
replace Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX> as president; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> operated as chairman,
chief executive officer and president for a period of time.) Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> is filled with thoughts of enjoying his three hobbies:
sailing, skiing and hunting.
</p>
<p>
   Asked why he would choose to voluntarily exit while he still is
so young, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> says it is time to be a tad selfish about how he
spends his days. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, who has a reputation as an
extraordinarily tough taskmaster, says that because he "had a great
time" in advertising," he doesn't want to "talk about the
disappointments." In fact, when he is asked his opinion of the new
batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Coke</ENAMEX> ads from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAA</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> places his hands over his
mouth. He shrugs. He doesn't utter a word. He has, he says, fond
memories of working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> executives. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> has given us great
highs," says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, sitting in his plush office, filled with
photographs of sailing as well as huge models of, among other
things, a Dutch tugboat.
</p>
<p>
   He says he feels a "great sense of accomplishment." In 36
countries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McCann</ENAMEX> is ranked in the top three; in 75 countries, it is
in the top 10.
</p>
<p>
   Soon, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> will be able to compete in as many sailing races
as he chooses. And concentrate on his duties as rear commodore at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Yacht Club</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Maybe he'll even leave something from his office for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooner</ENAMEX>.
Perhaps a framed page from the New York Times, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 8, 1987</TIMEX>,
showing a year-end chart of the stock market crash earlier that
year. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> says he framed it and kept it by his desk as a
"personal reminder. It can all be gone like that."

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX>, embarking on the daunting task of
combining three companies, announced a "transition" management team
that will consolidate the assets of recently acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount
Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.</ENAMEX>
after the completion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s separate merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> said the transition team will include two of its
executives and one from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>, all of whom will report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>
President and Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Biondi</ENAMEX>, 49 years old. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>
General Counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe P. Dauman</ENAMEX>, 40, will become executive vice
president and chief administrative officer, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas E. Dooley</ENAMEX>,
37, who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s corporate development, will become executive
vice president of finance, corporate development and communications.
</p>
<p>
   As reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Davis</ENAMEX> and President
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Jaffe</ENAMEX> will leave their executive posts, though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> is
working informally on the management transition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>
spokesman said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>'s formal representative on the transition
team is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald L. Nelson</ENAMEX>, 41, executive vice president and chief
financial officer. Whether he will have a longer-term role at the
merged companies and what it will be haven't been determined, though
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> executives say they want to keep him at the company.
</p>
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX> merger is expected to be voted on by its
shareholders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>; if it is completed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX> President and
Chief Operating Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven R. Berrard</ENAMEX>, 39, will join the
transition team.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>, which acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> for nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX> after a
five-month bidding contest with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVC Inc.</ENAMEX>, is swallowing two
companies considerably larger than itself; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> has some 12,500
employees to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s 5,000. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, has close to
40,000 employees, mostly in its retail stores nationwide.
</p>
<p>
   Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> officials decline to discuss layoffs, Wall Street
analysts expect the company, now heavily laden with debt, to sharply
cut staffing levels in such areas as television distribution, where
the three companies combined have four different overlapping units.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tinker</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furman Selz</ENAMEX>, said he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>
management to take <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX> in pretax restructuring charges that
include staff cutbacks in corporate and operations areas.
</p>
<p>
   During the bidding contest for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s advisers at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney Shearson</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> expected annual cost savings of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> at the minimum from, among other things, "elimination
of duplicate television production, distribution and sales" and
savings on overhead and administration costs.
</p>
<p>
   Speculation about cutbacks and executive changes has been rampant
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studio, where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumner Redstone</ENAMEX> recently had a week of intensive meetings.
Later, at the annual gathering of theatrical exhibitors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las
Vegas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Pictures</ENAMEX> studio chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry Lansing</ENAMEX> made reference
in a speech to the "turmoil" the studio has endured recently.
Following her at the podium, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX> told the audience, "the
turmoil is just beginning."
</p>
<p>
   Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dauman</ENAMEX> and others at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> who attended the session said
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX>'s remarks were made in a jesting manner, and noted that
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX> went on to make a number of positive remarks about the
studio. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> told the same gathering that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lansing</ENAMEX> and her
motion picture team "is our team," and he said yesterday that Ms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lansing</ENAMEX> has agreed to stay on.
</p>
<p>
   Still unclear is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> will name an executive to oversee
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>'s entertainment operations, which include the studio, TV
operations, theatrical exhibition, theme parks and Madison Square
Garden. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> declined to comment, although he acknowledged the
company is examining that option.

@  Amid Probe of Accounting Irregularities

<TXT>
<p>
   The chairman and the chief financial officer of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth Corp.</ENAMEX> have temporarily relinquished their posts while the
retailer conducts its investigation into alleged accounting
irregularities.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>'s board named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. Adams</ENAMEX>, an outside director, to
serve as interim chairman and chief executive officer while a
special committee, appointed by the board last week and led by Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, investigates the alleged irregularities. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, 69 years
old, is the retired chairman of Canadian-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emco Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a maker of
plumbing and petroleum equipment; he has served on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>
board since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   In a statement yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William K. Lavin</ENAMEX>,
chairman and chief executive, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles T. Young</ENAMEX>, chief financial
officer, stepped down voluntarily on a "temporary basis pending
conclusion" of the investigation.
</p>
<p>
   Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> "deny any wrongdoing" and told the
company "the sole reason for their action is to permit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> to
conduct business as usual" while the investigation proceeds, the
statement said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> didn't return telephone calls seeking
comment; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. The company said
it expects to name an interim chief financial officer soon.
</p>
<p>
   While the company hasn't commented on the probe, persons close to
the board said that Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX>, along with some other
top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> executives, were under investigation by the special
committee for their possible involvement in the alleged
irregularities. The committee is focusing on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>
executives knowingly reported inaccurate gross profit margins in at
least three of the company's quarterly reports during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal
year ended Jan. 29</TIMEX>. Gross margin is the difference between what the
retailer sold merchandise for and what it actually paid for it, and
is an important component used in calculating a company's net
income.
</p>
<p>
   The committee hired the law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton
& Garrison</ENAMEX> and accountant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KPMG Peat Marwick</ENAMEX> to assist in the
investigation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Weiss</ENAMEX> partner in charge of the
investigation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark A. Belnick</ENAMEX>, is expected to make a report of the
investigation to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>'s special committee in six to eight
weeks.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> has provided few details about the alleged
irregularities, except to say they will cause the retailer to
restate its quarterly results for the last fiscal year, reflecting
the "correction of gross margins." The company has said the
restatements aren't expected to have an impact on the full-year
results. The quarters affected are the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">first</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">second</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">third</TIMEX> of
the last fiscal year. People close to the board said the
inaccuracies were corrected during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   Though the board has been told the margin discrepancies are
modest -- in one quarter the gross margin was misstated by about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16
million</NUMEX> -- the board has learned the inaccurate gross margin numbers
probably led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> to report moderate interim after-tax profit
rather than moderate after-tax losses for at least two quarters in
the past fiscal year, according to people familiar with
investigation.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>, which had revenue last year of close to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX>,
is now concerned the news of alleged irregularities could damage its
relationship with suppliers and retail-credit companies. In its
statement yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> said it reassured several of its
"key" suppliers that the events of the past week won't have any
"material adverse impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>'s financial position." The
company added that none of the major suppliers contacted "has
indicated that it won't continue to ship to the company." The
statement followed reports in this and other newspapers last week
that several factoring companies and credit services had told
suppliers to hold shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> until details of the
investigation could be learned.
</p>
<p>
   "The allegations have to be put to bed. It's hurting the
company," said a person close to the board. "The credibility
question has to be dealt with." A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> board member, speaking
independently, said, "The company is clean and strong financially,
but this has been a real shakeup."
</p>
<p>
   According to people close to the board, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, who is also
chairman of the board's audit committee, learned of the quarterly
inaccuracies from a "high-level manager" at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>
headquarters in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. After inquiries, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> learned
the allegations had "some substance," the people said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>
then called in the company's standing outside auditor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price
Waterhouse</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peat Marwick</ENAMEX>, to each go over the company's
quarterly statements. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" ALT="March 26">the weekend of March 26</TIMEX>, the two
accounting firms concurred that "sufficient discrepancies" existed
to require a restatement of the company's quarterly numbers for at
least the last fiscal year. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for
comment.
</p>
<p>
   Though the investigation has barely begun, persons close to the
board said Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> will get a "hard look" as to
whether they were involved, and are both considered a "natural
focus" of the inquiry. The persons added that the investigation will
also include any top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> executives who "had knowledge or
involvement in the reporting of the quarterly numbers."
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> and other company executives, are named in a
number of shareholder suits filed late last week in federal court in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>'s chief financial officer for
several years until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1, 1993</TIMEX>, when he was named chairman and
chief executive.
</p>
<p>
   One suit claims Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> had access to "adverse" information and
"knew, or was grossly reckless in not knowing, of the fraud
alleged." The suit claims Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavin</ENAMEX> acted to "conceal adverse
material information" regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>'s finances in an effort to
"increase and maintain an artificially high market price for the
common stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>."
</p>
<p>
   Other suits charge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> executives and directors sold stock
at prices above last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s closing price and before the
alleged irregularities came to light. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> shares closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15.125</NUMEX>, ending the week down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX>. The shares have plummeted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 31</TIMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   The investigation follows a wrenching period for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>, whose
origins date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1879</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>, attempting to pare away
unprofitable businesses, has spent the past two years selling off
and closing hundreds of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> variety stores, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinney</ENAMEX> shoe
stores, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolco</ENAMEX> store operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. The company has
been forced to liquidate many stores and has taken losses reflecting
markdowns, a process some board members believe may have contributed
to reporting inaccurate gross margin numbers.
</p>
<p>
   Board members are mystified as to why executives would knowingly
submit or approve inaccurate gross margins numbers since they have
no connection to executives' compensation, stock-buying plans, or
any other incentives. Executives can earn cash bonuses, but only
based on pretax profit goals determined from year-end audited
results.
</p>
<p>
   "There is no evidence that any of them would have gained
personally from this, or get any advantage," said one board member.
"That's what adds to the mystery here."

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Sagan</ENAMEX>, the noted astronomer, is a funny
man. Just ask his wife:
</p>
<p>
   "A laugh a minute," she says.
</p>
<p>
   Other people he doesn't always find so amusing. For example: He
does not consider himself a Butt-Head Astronomer, and those who have
intimated that he is have been hauled into court. Sued, by unsmiling
lawyers.
</p>
<p>
   This all began a few months ago. Nerds over at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer
Inc.</ENAMEX> were putting together some new computer models. Customarily,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> gives these machines secret code names during development, and
real names when they are ready to be sold to the public. Code-naming
is considered an honor. "You pick a name of someone you . . .
respect," explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Macgillivray</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> computer
consultant.
</p>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> has had computers in the works named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gershwin</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</ENAMEX>. And more recently, somebody plucked out Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> as a code-name honoree. The nerds reportedly jested: Maybe the
name would be lucky, propelling the computers to sales of "billions
and billions." Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX>, of course, is known for his TV programs
about celestial events "billions and billions of years ago."
</p>
<p>
   Somebody wrote about this in a computer magazine. But when Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX> professor, learned of the purported
honor, he didn't laugh. His lawyers wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> to complain that
this was an illegal usurpation of his name for commercial purposes.
Fine, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>.
</p>
<p>
   But the nerds were more mischievous. They changed the code name,
all right. To the abbreviation BHA. When inquiring minds asked what
this meant, they supposedly were told: "Butt-Head Astronomer."
</p>
<p>
   This traveled at light speed to the 59-year-old astronomer. He
sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> last week in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. District Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. The suit
contends that calling Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> a "Butt-Head Astronomer" is
"defamatory on its face" and has subjected him to "hatred, contempt,
ridicule and obloquy." He is seeking unspecified damages. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX>
wasn't available and his lawyer declined to comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> won't,
either, though a spokesman -- contrary to previous accounts -- says
the BHA designation that replaced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" STATUS="OPT">Sagan</ENAMEX> code name was "randomly
chosen."
</p>
<p>
   Some lawyers expect Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX>'s suit to flame out. It is doubtful
that an unofficial code name is a commercial use of his name, they
say. And, under recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings on libel, it is
unlikely that "butt-head" will be seen as defamatory, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin
Baine</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> lawyer. "If you refer to someone as a butt-head,
ordinarily speaking, no one is going to take that as any specific
charge of any improper conduct or insinuation of any character
trait," he says.
</p>
<p>
   A big question, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baine</ENAMEX> says, that would have to be answered at
trial: What exactly is a butt-head, anyway? As portrayed by the
demonic characters on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">MTV</ENAMEX>'s "Beavis and Butt-head" cartoon series, a
butt-head is a wise-cracking lout. Not so, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laid Back
Enterprises</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>, which claims a trademark on an amiable
cartoon character named "Butthead." "We consider our Butthead to be
an endearing, fun-loving guy," a spokesman says.

less work in progress than it did a year earlier. He also cited
competitive pricing.

   But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> said the company is "looking at a strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">second
half</TIMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviall</ENAMEX> has some price increases due in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half</TIMEX>, and
the company recently renewed or extended engine-overhaul contracts
with its four biggest customers.
