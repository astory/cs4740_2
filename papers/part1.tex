%By 11:59pm, Thursday, March 10th, you need to submit:
%1. A short document that indicates your plan for the project
\title{Sequence Tagging: Part One}
\author{Thomas Levine and Alec Story}
\begin{document}
%which data set(s) and algorithm(s) will you include? will you implement the
\section{Data set}
We will study part-of-speech tagging.
\section{Algorithms}
We will implement the sequence tagging algorithm ourselves.
We will implement arbitrary length n-gram extraction and the Viterbi algorithm.
We will plan on handling unknown words. %how?
We will use good-turing smoothing on transition and lexical generation probabilities. %This could change.


%2. The document should describe the baseline system, report the baseline
%predictions for the task, and explain how you got them(e.g. wrote your
%own code, used a package, used the web-based scorer).
\section{Baseline system}
Our baseline system includes n-gram extraction.
It currently does not include the hidden Markov model.
Instead, it currently selects tags weighted
to word and tag frequencies but
without respect for context.

%3. The code for the baseline system if you are implementing from
%scratch. If you are using a package, do not submit the code.
